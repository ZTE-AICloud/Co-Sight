Word History
Etymology
Noun
 Middle English fruit, frute, froyte, fructe, borrowed from Anglo-French fruit, frut (also continental Old French), going back to Latin frūctus "pleasurable possession (of something), right to enjoy the profits (of something), useful products of nature, fruit, profit, advantage," from frūg-, base of fruor, fruī "to enjoy the produce or proceeds of, derive advantage from, be blessed with, derive pleasure from" (probably going back to *frūu?ōr < *frūi?ōr < *frūgi?ōr, from a dialectal Indo-European verbal base *bhruHg- "enjoy, use") + -tus, suffix of action nouns — more at brook entry 2 
Note:
 Though the derivation of fruor from frūg- is uncontested, the sequence of shifts that led to the loss of -g- is uncertain. 
Verb
 Middle English fruiten, derivative of fruit fruit entry 1

Progress: 5/6 steps completed (83.3%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Understand the botanical definition of vegetables versus fruits
   Notes: Identified key botanical distinctions:
- Fruits: Ripened ovary of seed plants, contains seeds, develops from flowers
- Vegetables: Other edible plant parts (leaves, stems, roots)
- Critical distinction: Fruits are reproductive structures containing seeds, vegetables are vegetative parts

Sources:
- Merriam-Webster definitions

Next step: Review complete grocery list using these criteria
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Review the complete grocery list (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Completed review of grocery list:
- Identified 5 true botanical vegetables
- Flagged common misconceptions (e.g. green beans, zucchini)
- Noted botanical distinctions for each item

Next steps:
- Proceed to classification step
- Filter out only vegetables
- Alphabetize results

No files generated in this step.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Classify each item as botanical fruit or vegetable (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Classified each grocery item as botanical fruit or vegetable:
