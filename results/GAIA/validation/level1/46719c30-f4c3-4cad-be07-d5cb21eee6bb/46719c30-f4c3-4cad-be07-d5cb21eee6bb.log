2. For Iram N. Khan, I found no evidence of publications prior to the 2015 paper with Pietro Murano. All search results for Iram N. Khan primarily point to the 2015 paper "Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?" suggesting this was likely Khan's first publication.

Therefore, Pietro Murano is the author who had published papers prior to the 2015 paper. We need to determine which of his 2001 papers was published first to answer the original question.

Plan does not need adjustment, continue execution

The next step is to determine which of Pietro Murano's 2001 papers was published first:
- "A new software agent 'learning' algorithm" (2001)
- "Mapping human-oriented information to software agents for online systems usage" (2001)

Both papers were published in the same conference proceedings: "2001 People in Control. The Second International Conference on Human Interfaces in Control Rooms, Cockpits and Command Centres." You'll need to find more detailed publication information, such as the exact publication date or the order of papers in the conference proceedings, to determine which one was published first.

INTRODUCTION 
This  paper  describes  a  new  software  agent  (Bradshaw  1997)  'learning'  algorithm.  The  
philosophy this new algorithm is based on will also be outlined  in the paper. The new  
algorithm 'observes' a user and, based on the user's action, or lack of actions, will make a set  
of 'inference(s)', and offer the user help/advice appropriate to the user's current situation.  
Furthermore, the algorithm can take into account a user's previous knowledge if this is made  
apparent by a user, while interacting with the system. The algorithm can be tailored in such a  
way that it can be of use to an agent in various virtual environments. The described 'learning'  
algorithm has been implemented with the aim of helping novices get started with UNIX  
commands (Gilly 1994). UNIX commands are typically very difficult for a novice to learn.  
The algorithm could be effectively modified to help novices learn other new interfaces, such  
as those found in command centres and control rooms. Such an algorithm would be a good  
tool in a training environment, as an addition to existing tools. 
To that end this paper will consider: 
? some of the existing related work on learning algorithms, 
? a description of the new algorithm developed, 
? areas where the algorithm could help in a command/control room environment. 
SOFTWARE AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Some algorithms developed for software agents involve the agent 'observing' the user and  
making some kind of 'conclusion' on what the user has done. Then the agent will take some  
action based on this. 
The software agent described in (Lieberman 1995) is such an agent. The aim of the agent is to  
'observe' a user that browses the WWW, and based on the browsing pattern of the user, the  
agent will 'browse' in parallel relevant links. The algorithm incorporates heuristics and a best-
first search. An innovative aspect of this software agent is the fact that a user does not need to  
communicate to the agent their intentions. Instead the agent attempts to discover what the  
user's intentions are by 'observation'. 
In (Lieberman 1997), it is suggested that users at the interface give a system information 'for  
free'. It is advised that this information should be used by the agent to make inferences, with  
the  aim  of  helping  the  user.  Lieberman  further  suggests  that  an  agent,  particularly  an  
autonomous one, can make use of a user's pause time at the interface. 
In (Maes 1994), the idea of an agent 'learning' its behaviour is proposed. The aim is for a  
software agent to 'observe' a user and based on the observation(s), provide appropriate user  
assistance. Maes also allows the option of an agent receiving instructions from the 'human' or  
even to learn from other software agents. A NEW 'LEARNING' ALGORITHM
The new algorithm discussed here, uses a similar philosophy to the types  of algorithms  
discussed by Lieberman and Maes. This new algorithm uses heuristics and 'observes' a user's  
actions. Based on these, the software agent makes 'decisions' or infers how to best assist a  
user.  Furthermore  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  agent  via  Automatic  Speech  
Recognition (ASR). 
The  setting  used  for  the  new  algorithm  was  UNIX  commands.  For  beginners  this  is  a  
notoriously difficult task requiring effort and perseverance. Furthermore, beginners may be  
computing beginners in general or beginners to UNIX only. Someone could be an expert in  
DOS, but know nothing of UNIX commands. Even for experienced users it can be awkward  
to remember 'a particular' command for accomplishing a specialised purpose. The difference  
with this scenario is that experienced users will be in a better position to find the information  
they need. 
These aspects were considered in the development of the prototype learning algorithm for the  
software agent. A further consideration was the wish to interfere as little as possible with the  
original UNIX X-Windows look and feel. This was so that a user did not need to learn  
'another' interface, but would only need to interact with the software agent. 
Assuming a user has begun a session at a console, the software agent immediately begins by  
observing the user. If the agent sees that the user has not hesitated, but has made a successful  
start, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  
software agent waits in the background continually observing the user's behaviour. This can  
be illustrated as shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: No user hesitation 
If the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  
assistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  
result of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  
situation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  
take control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  
Figure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered 
If though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  
hesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  
This is illustrated in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: Novice UNIX user
The agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  
receiving a request the agent will 'show' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  
is illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help
The agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  
does not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  
happens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  
or that the user is a beginner. The agent also 'bows out gracefully' if upon asking the user  
what they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  
circumstance does not 'insist' on a reply, but returns to 'observing' in the background. 
If a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  
and offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  
Figure 5: 
Figure 5: DOS user
If the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  
though the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  
what the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  
errors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  
trying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters 'pw d', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input 'pwd' and advise that there should be no spaces in 'pwd'. This is a simple  
example, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  
commands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. 
The author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  
was  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  'Software  Agent  
Learning Algorithms above) 'observes' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  
observation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  
composition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  
author, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  
ever correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  
quickly and conveniently. However in the author's experience the most efficient way to enter  
text is to switch off the predictive text input. 
APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS
The idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  
working is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  
philosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  
some  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  
algorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  
would be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  
modified for use in an 'update' to an operator's training (discussed below). 
The paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  
environment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  
simulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  
Piping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  
involving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  
which display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  
together. 
They concluded that 'pattern matching displays', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  
anomalies, but seemed to 'cause' users to make judgements too early on. Instead 'time related'  
information, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to 'cause' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  
tended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  
MDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  
for resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). 
One of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  
simultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  
described above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  
As Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  
happens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  
situation based on the operator's action(s), and on the 'knowledge' it would hold regarding the  
current process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  
UNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  
operators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  
a problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. 
A further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  
situation of a 'plant' converting from a 'hard desk' to a 'soft desk'. This issue of transition is  
discussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face 'a major  
cultural change'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the 'soft  
desk'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that 'soft  
desks' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with 'hard desks'. Furthermore, the  
data is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  
Interface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  
function keys. 
Dicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the 'soft desk', and that after an  
initial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  
based, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  
algorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  
be set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  
the  'soft  desk',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  
screen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  
for information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  
the agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  
initial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  
e.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. 
CONCLUSIONS
The described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  
UNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  
the feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. 'ls  
-l' can be written by novices as 'ls-l'. The software agent has also been developed with the  
option of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it's awkward to turn  
them off, e.g. Microsoft 'paper clip'. 
It has also been partially tested with users who were non UNIX users. The algorithm is  
proving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  
around the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  
training) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  
find the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  
mentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  
prompting a user if they hesitate excessively. 
A negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  
the agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  
inferences based on the user's actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  
agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.

proving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  
around the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  
training) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  
find the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  
mentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  
prompting a user if they hesitate excessively. 
A negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  
the agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  
inferences based on the user's actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  
agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.

The  \nphilosophy this new algorithm is based on will also be outlined  in the paper. The new  \nalgorithm \'observes\' a user and, based on the user\'s action, or lack of actions, will make a set  \nof \'inference(s)\', and offer the user help/advice appropriate to the user\'s current situation.  \nFurthermore, the algorithm can take into account a user\'s previous knowledge if this is made  \napparent by a user, while interacting with the system. The algorithm can be tailored in such a  \nway that it can be of use to an agent in various virtual environments. The described \'learning\'  \nalgorithm has been implemented with the aim of helping novices get started with UNIX  \ncommands (Gilly 1994). UNIX commands are typically very difficult for a novice to learn.  \nThe algorithm could be effectively modified to help novices learn other new interfaces, such  \nas those found in command centres and control rooms. Such an algorithm would be a good  \ntool in a training environment, as an addition to existing tools. \nTo that end this paper will consider: \n\uf0b7 some of the existing related work on learning algorithms, \n\uf0b7 a description of the new algorithm developed, \n\uf0b7 areas where the algorithm could help in a command/control room environment. \nSOFTWARE AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS\nSome algorithms developed for software agents involve the agent \'observing\' the user and  \nmaking some kind of \'conclusion\' on what the user has done. Then the agent will take some  \naction based on this. \nThe software agent described in (Lieberman 1995) is such an agent. The aim of the agent is to  \n\'observe\' a user that browses the WWW, and based on the browsing pattern of the user, the  \nagent will \'browse\' in parallel relevant links. The algorithm incorporates heuristics and a best-\nfirst search. An innovative aspect of this software agent is the fact that a user does not need to  \ncommunicate to the agent their intentions. Instead the agent attempts to discover what the  \nuser\'s intentions are by \'observation\'. \nIn (Lieberman 1997), it is suggested that users at the interface give a system information \'for  \nfree\'. It is advised that this information should be used by the agent to make inferences, with  \nthe  aim  of  helping  the  user.  Lieberman  further  suggests  that  an  agent,  particularly  an  \nautonomous one, can make use of a user\'s pause time at the interface. \nIn (Maes 1994), the idea of an agent \'learning\' its behaviour is proposed. The aim is for a  \nsoftware agent to \'observe\' a user and based on the observation(s), provide appropriate user  \nassistance. Maes also allows the option of an agent receiving instructions from the \'human\' or  \neven to learn from other software agents. A NEW \'LEARNING\' ALGORITHM\nThe new algorithm discussed here, uses a similar philosophy to the types  of algorithms  \ndiscussed by Lieberman and Maes. This new algorithm uses heuristics and \'observes\' a user\'s  \nactions. Based on these, the software agent makes \'decisions\' or infers how to best assist a  \nuser.  Furthermore  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  agent  via  Automatic  Speech  \nRecognition (ASR). \nThe  setting  used  for  the  new  algorithm  was  UNIX  commands.  For  beginners  this  is  a  \nnotoriously difficult task requiring effort and perseverance. Furthermore, beginners may be  \ncomputing beginners in general or beginners to UNIX only. Someone could be an expert in  \nDOS, but know nothing of UNIX commands. Even for experienced users it can be awkward  \nto remember \'a particular\' command for accomplishing a specialised purpose. The difference  \nwith this scenario is that experienced users will be in a better position to find the information  \nthey need. \nThese aspects were considered in the development of the prototype learning algorithm for the  \nsoftware agent. A further consideration was the wish to interfere as little as possible with the  \noriginal UNIX X-Windows look and feel. This was so that a user did not need to learn  \n\'another\' interface, but would only need to interact with the software agent. \nAssuming a user has begun a session at a console, the software agent immediately begins by  \nobserving the user. If the agent sees that the user has not hesitated, but has made a successful  \nstart, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  \nsoftware agent waits in the background continually observing the user\'s behaviour. This can  \nbe illustrated as shown in Figure 1: \nFigure 1: No user hesitation \nIf the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  \nassistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  \nresult of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  \nsituation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  \ntake control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  \nFigure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered \nIf though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  \nhesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  \nThis is illustrated in Figure 3: \nFigure 3: Novice UNIX user\nThe agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  \nreceiving a request the agent will \'show\' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  \nis illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help\nThe agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  \ndoes not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  \nhappens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  \nor that the user is a beginner. The agent also \'bows out gracefully\' if upon asking the user  \nwhat they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  \ncircumstance does not \'insist\' on a reply, but returns to \'observing\' in the background. \nIf a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  \nand offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  \nFigure 5: \nFigure 5: DOS user\nIf the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  \nthough the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  \nwhat the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  \nerrors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  \ntrying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters \'pw d\', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input \'pwd\' and advise that there should be no spaces in \'pwd\'. This is a simple  \nexample, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  \ncommands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. \nThe author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  \nwas  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  \'Software  Agent  \nLearning Algorithms above) \'observes\' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  \nobservation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  \ncomposition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  \nauthor, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  \never correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  \nquickly and conveniently. However in the author\'s experience the most efficient way to enter  \ntext is to switch off the predictive text input. \nAPPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS\nThe idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  \nworking is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  \nphilosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  \nsome  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  \nalgorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  \nwould be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  \nmodified for use in an \'update\' to an operator\'s training (discussed below). \nThe paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  \nenvironment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  \nsimulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  \nPiping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  \ninvolving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  \nwhich display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  \ntogether. \nThey concluded that \'pattern matching displays\', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  \nanomalies, but seemed to \'cause\' users to make judgements too early on. Instead \'time related\'  \ninformation, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to \'cause\' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  \ntended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  \nMDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  \nfor resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). \nOne of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  \nsimultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  \ndescribed above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  \nAs Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  \nhappens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  \nsituation based on the operator\'s action(s), and on the \'knowledge\' it would hold regarding the  \ncurrent process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  \nUNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  \noperators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  \na problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. \nA further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  \nsituation of a \'plant\' converting from a \'hard desk\' to a \'soft desk\'. This issue of transition is  \ndiscussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face \'a major  \ncultural change\'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the \'soft  \ndesk\'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that \'soft  \ndesks\' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with \'hard desks\'. Furthermore, the  \ndata is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  \nInterface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  \nfunction keys. \nDicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the \'soft desk\', and that after an  \ninitial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  \nbased, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  \nalgorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  \nbe set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  \nthe  \'soft  desk\',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  \nscreen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  \nfor information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  \nthe agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  \ninitial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  \ne.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  \nUNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  \nthe feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. \'ls  \n-l\' can be written by novices as \'ls-l\'. The software agent has also been developed with the  \noption of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it\'s awkward to turn  \nthem off, e.g. Microsoft \'paper clip\'. \nIt has also been partially tested with users who were non UNIX users. The algorithm is  \nproving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  \naround the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  \ntraining) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  \nfind the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  \nmentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  \nprompting a user if they hesitate excessively. \nA negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  \nthe agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  \ninferences based on the user\'s actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  \nagent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  \nShneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  \nagents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  \nsituations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  \nin training and every day work within a control room or command centre. \nREFERENCES\nBoussoffara, B. and P. F. Elzer (1999).

INTRODUCTION 
This  paper  describes  a  new  software  agent  (Bradshaw  1997)  'learning'  algorithm.  The  
philosophy this new algorithm is based on will also be outlined  in the paper. The new  
algorithm 'observes' a user and, based on the user's action, or lack of actions, will make a set  
of 'inference(s)', and offer the user help/advice appropriate to the user's current situation.  
Furthermore, the algorithm can take into account a user's previous knowledge if this is made  
apparent by a user, while interacting with the system. The algorithm can be tailored in such a  
way that it can be of use to an agent in various virtual environments. The described 'learning'  
algorithm has been implemented with the aim of helping novices get started with UNIX  
commands (Gilly 1994). UNIX commands are typically very difficult for a novice to learn.  
The algorithm could be effectively modified to help novices learn other new interfaces, such  
as those found in command centres and control rooms. Such an algorithm would be a good  
tool in a training environment, as an addition to existing tools. 
To that end this paper will consider: 
? some of the existing related work on learning algorithms, 
? a description of the new algorithm developed, 
? areas where the algorithm could help in a command/control room environment. 
SOFTWARE AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Some algorithms developed for software agents involve the agent 'observing' the user and  
making some kind of 'conclusion' on what the user has done. Then the agent will take some  
action based on this. 
The software agent described in (Lieberman 1995) is such an agent. The aim of the agent is to  
'observe' a user that browses the WWW, and based on the browsing pattern of the user, the  
agent will 'browse' in parallel relevant links. The algorithm incorporates heuristics and a best-
first search. An innovative aspect of this software agent is the fact that a user does not need to  
communicate to the agent their intentions. Instead the agent attempts to discover what the  
user's intentions are by 'observation'. 
In (Lieberman 1997), it is suggested that users at the interface give a system information 'for  
free'. It is advised that this information should be used by the agent to make inferences, with  
the  aim  of  helping  the  user.  Lieberman  further  suggests  that  an  agent,  particularly  an  
autonomous one, can make use of a user's pause time at the interface. 
In (Maes 1994), the idea of an agent 'learning' its behaviour is proposed. The aim is for a  
software agent to 'observe' a user and based on the observation(s), provide appropriate user  
assistance. Maes also allows the option of an agent receiving instructions from the 'human' or  
even to learn from other software agents. A NEW 'LEARNING' ALGORITHM
The new algorithm discussed here, uses a similar philosophy to the types  of algorithms  
discussed by Lieberman and Maes. This new algorithm uses heuristics and 'observes' a user's  
actions. Based on these, the software agent makes 'decisions' or infers how to best assist a  
user.  Furthermore  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  agent  via  Automatic  Speech  
Recognition (ASR). 
The  setting  used  for  the  new  algorithm  was  UNIX  commands.  For  beginners  this  is  a  
notoriously difficult task requiring effort and perseverance. Furthermore, beginners may be  
computing beginners in general or beginners to UNIX only. Someone could be an expert in  
DOS, but know nothing of UNIX commands. Even for experienced users it can be awkward  
to remember 'a particular' command for accomplishing a specialised purpose. The difference  
with this scenario is that experienced users will be in a better position to find the information  
they need. 
These aspects were considered in the development of the prototype learning algorithm for the  
software agent. A further consideration was the wish to interfere as little as possible with the  
original UNIX X-Windows look and feel. This was so that a user did not need to learn  
'another' interface, but would only need to interact with the software agent. 
Assuming a user has begun a session at a console, the software agent immediately begins by  
observing the user. If the agent sees that the user has not hesitated, but has made a successful  
start, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  
software agent waits in the background continually observing the user's behaviour. This can  
be illustrated as shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: No user hesitation 
If the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  
assistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  
result of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  
situation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  
take control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  
Figure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered 
If though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  
hesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  
This is illustrated in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: Novice UNIX user
The agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  
receiving a request the agent will 'show' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  
is illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help
The agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  
does not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  
happens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  
or that the user is a beginner. The agent also 'bows out gracefully' if upon asking the user  
what they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  
circumstance does not 'insist' on a reply, but returns to 'observing' in the background. 
If a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  
and offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  
Figure 5: 
Figure 5: DOS user
If the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  
though the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  
what the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  
errors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  
trying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters 'pw d', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input 'pwd' and advise that there should be no spaces in 'pwd'. This is a simple  
example, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  
commands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. 
The author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  
was  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  'Software  Agent  
Learning Algorithms above) 'observes' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  
observation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  
composition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  
author, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  
ever correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  
quickly and conveniently. However in the author's experience the most efficient way to enter  
text is to switch off the predictive text input. 
APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS
The idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  
working is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  
philosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  
some  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  
algorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  
would be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  
modified for use in an 'update' to an operator's training (discussed below). 
The paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  
environment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  
simulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  
Piping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  
involving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  
which display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  
together. 
They concluded that 'pattern matching displays', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  
anomalies, but seemed to 'cause' users to make judgements too early on. Instead 'time related'  
information, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to 'cause' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  
tended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  
MDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  
for resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). 
One of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  
simultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  
described above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  
As Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  
happens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  
situation based on the operator's action(s), and on the 'knowledge' it would hold regarding the  
current process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  
UNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  
operators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  
a problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. 
A further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  
situation of a 'plant' converting from a 'hard desk' to a 'soft desk'. This issue of transition is  
discussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face 'a major  
cultural change'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the 'soft  
desk'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that 'soft  
desks' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with 'hard desks'. Furthermore, the  
data is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  
Interface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  
function keys. 
Dicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the 'soft desk', and that after an  
initial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  
based, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  
algorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  
be set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  
the  'soft  desk',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  
screen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  
for information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  
the agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  
initial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  
e.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. 
CONCLUSIONS
The described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  
UNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  
the feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. 'ls  
-l' can be written by novices as 'ls-l'. The software agent has also been developed with the  
option of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it's awkward to turn  
them off, e.g. Microsoft 'paper clip'. 
It has also been partially tested with users who were non UNIX users. The algorithm is  
proving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  
around the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  
training) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  
find the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  
mentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  
prompting a user if they hesitate excessively. 
A negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  
the agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  
inferences based on the user's actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  
agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.

   Notes: A New Software Agent 'Learning' Algorithm 
Pietro Murano 
INTRODUCTION 
This  paper  describes  a  new  software  agent  (Bradshaw  1997)  'learning'  algorithm.  The  
philosophy this new algorithm is based on will also be outlined  in the paper. The new  
algorithm 'observes' a user and, based on the user's action, or lack of actions, will make a set  
of 'inference(s)', and offer the user help/advice appropriate to the user's current situation.  
Furthermore, the algorithm can take into account a user's previous knowledge if this is made  
apparent by a user, while interacting with the system. The algorithm can be tailored in such a  
way that it can be of use to an agent in various virtual environments. The described 'learning'  
algorithm has been implemented with the aim of helping novices get started with UNIX  
commands (Gilly 1994). UNIX commands are typically very difficult for a novice to learn.  
The algorithm could be effectively modified to help novices learn other new interfaces, such  
as those found in command centres and control rooms. Such an algorithm would be a good  
tool in a training environment, as an addition to existing tools. 
To that end this paper will consider: 
? some of the existing related work on learning algorithms, 
? a description of the new algorithm developed, 
? areas where the algorithm could help in a command/control room environment. 
SOFTWARE AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Some algorithms developed for software agents involve the agent 'observing' the user and  
making some kind of 'conclusion' on what the user has done. Then the agent will take some  
action based on this. 
The software agent described in (Lieberman 1995) is such an agent. The aim of the agent is to  
'observe' a user that browses the WWW, and based on the browsing pattern of the user, the  
agent will 'browse' in parallel relevant links. The algorithm incorporates heuristics and a best-
first search. An innovative aspect of this software agent is the fact that a user does not need to  
communicate to the agent their intentions. Instead the agent attempts to discover what the  
user's intentions are by 'observation'. 
In (Lieberman 1997), it is suggested that users at the interface give a system information 'for  
free'. It is advised that this information should be used by the agent to make inferences, with  
the  aim  of  helping  the  user.  Lieberman  further  suggests  that  an  agent,  particularly  an  
autonomous one, can make use of a user's pause time at the interface. 
In (Maes 1994), the idea of an agent 'learning' its behaviour is proposed. The aim is for a  
software agent to 'observe' a user and based on the observation(s), provide appropriate user  
assistance. Maes also allows the option of an agent receiving instructions from the 'human' or  
even to learn from other software agents. A NEW 'LEARNING' ALGORITHM
The new algorithm discussed here, uses a similar philosophy to the types  of algorithms  
discussed by Lieberman and Maes. This new algorithm uses heuristics and 'observes' a user's  
actions. Based on these, the software agent makes 'decisions' or infers how to best assist a  
user.  Furthermore  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  agent  via  Automatic  Speech  
Recognition (ASR). 
The  setting  used  for  the  new  algorithm  was  UNIX  commands.  For  beginners  this  is  a  
notoriously difficult task requiring effort and perseverance. Furthermore, beginners may be  
computing beginners in general or beginners to UNIX only. Someone could be an expert in  
DOS, but know nothing of UNIX commands. Even for experienced users it can be awkward  
to remember 'a particular' command for accomplishing a specialised purpose. The difference  
with this scenario is that experienced users will be in a better position to find the information  
they need. 
These aspects were considered in the development of the prototype learning algorithm for the  
software agent. A further consideration was the wish to interfere as little as possible with the  
original UNIX X-Windows look and feel. This was so that a user did not need to learn  
'another' interface, but would only need to interact with the software agent. 
Assuming a user has begun a session at a console, the software agent immediately begins by  
observing the user. If the agent sees that the user has not hesitated, but has made a successful  
start, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  
software agent waits in the background continually observing the user's behaviour. This can  
be illustrated as shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: No user hesitation 
If the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  
assistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  
result of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  
situation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  
take control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  
Figure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered 
If though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  
hesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  
This is illustrated in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: Novice UNIX user
The agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  
receiving a request the agent will 'show' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  
is illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help
The agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  
does not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  
happens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  
or that the user is a beginner. The agent also 'bows out gracefully' if upon asking the user  
what they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  
circumstance does not 'insist' on a reply, but returns to 'observing' in the background. 
If a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  
and offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  
Figure 5: 
Figure 5: DOS user
If the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  
though the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  
what the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  
errors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  
trying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters 'pw d', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input 'pwd' and advise that there should be no spaces in 'pwd'. This is a simple  
example, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  
commands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. 
The author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  
was  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  'Software  Agent  
Learning Algorithms above) 'observes' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  
observation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  
composition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  
author, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  
ever correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  
quickly and conveniently. However in the author's experience the most efficient way to enter  
text is to switch off the predictive text input. 
APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS
The idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  
working is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  
philosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  
some  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  
algorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  
would be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  
modified for use in an 'update' to an operator's training (discussed below). 
The paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  
environment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  
simulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  
Piping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  
involving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  
which display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  
together. 
They concluded that 'pattern matching displays', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  
anomalies, but seemed to 'cause' users to make judgements too early on. Instead 'time related'  
information, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to 'cause' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  
tended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  
MDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  
for resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). 
One of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  
simultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  
described above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  
As Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  
happens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  
situation based on the operator's action(s), and on the 'knowledge' it would hold regarding the  
current process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  
UNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  
operators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  
a problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. 
A further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  
situation of a 'plant' converting from a 'hard desk' to a 'soft desk'. This issue of transition is  
discussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face 'a major  
cultural change'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the 'soft  
desk'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that 'soft  
desks' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with 'hard desks'. Furthermore, the  
data is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  
Interface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  
function keys. 
Dicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the 'soft desk', and that after an  
initial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  
based, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  
algorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  
be set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  
the  'soft  desk',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  
screen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  
for information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  
the agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  
initial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  
e.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. 
CONCLUSIONS
The described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  
UNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  
the feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. 'ls  
-l' can be written by novices as 'ls-l'. The software agent has also been developed with the  
option of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it's awkward to turn

agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.

   Notes: A New Software Agent 'Learning' Algorithm 
Pietro Murano 
INTRODUCTION 
This  paper  describes  a  new  software  agent  (Bradshaw  1997)  'learning'  algorithm.  The  
philosophy this new algorithm is based on will also be outlined  in the paper. The new  
algorithm 'observes' a user and, based on the user's action, or lack of actions, will make a set  
of 'inference(s)', and offer the user help/advice appropriate to the user's current situation.  
Furthermore, the algorithm can take into account a user's previous knowledge if this is made  
apparent by a user, while interacting with the system. The algorithm can be tailored in such a  
way that it can be of use to an agent in various virtual environments. The described 'learning'  
algorithm has been implemented with the aim of helping novices get started with UNIX  
commands (Gilly 1994). UNIX commands are typically very difficult for a novice to learn.  
The algorithm could be effectively modified to help novices learn other new interfaces, such  
as those found in command centres and control rooms. Such an algorithm would be a good  
tool in a training environment, as an addition to existing tools. 
To that end this paper will consider: 
? some of the existing related work on learning algorithms, 
? a description of the new algorithm developed, 
? areas where the algorithm could help in a command/control room environment. 
SOFTWARE AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Some algorithms developed for software agents involve the agent 'observing' the user and  
making some kind of 'conclusion' on what the user has done. Then the agent will take some  
action based on this. 
The software agent described in (Lieberman 1995) is such an agent. The aim of the agent is to  
'observe' a user that browses the WWW, and based on the browsing pattern of the user, the  
agent will 'browse' in parallel relevant links. The algorithm incorporates heuristics and a best-
first search. An innovative aspect of this software agent is the fact that a user does not need to  
communicate to the agent their intentions. Instead the agent attempts to discover what the  
user's intentions are by 'observation'. 
In (Lieberman 1997), it is suggested that users at the interface give a system information 'for  
free'. It is advised that this information should be used by the agent to make inferences, with  
the  aim  of  helping  the  user.  Lieberman  further  suggests  that  an  agent,  particularly  an  
autonomous one, can make use of a user's pause time at the interface. 
In (Maes 1994), the idea of an agent 'learning' its behaviour is proposed. The aim is for a  
software agent to 'observe' a user and based on the observation(s), provide appropriate user  
assistance. Maes also allows the option of an agent receiving instructions from the 'human' or  
even to learn from other software agents. A NEW 'LEARNING' ALGORITHM
The new algorithm discussed here, uses a similar philosophy to the types  of algorithms  
discussed by Lieberman and Maes. This new algorithm uses heuristics and 'observes' a user's  
actions. Based on these, the software agent makes 'decisions' or infers how to best assist a  
user.  Furthermore  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  agent  via  Automatic  Speech  
Recognition (ASR). 
The  setting  used  for  the  new  algorithm  was  UNIX  commands.  For  beginners  this  is  a  
notoriously difficult task requiring effort and perseverance. Furthermore, beginners may be  
computing beginners in general or beginners to UNIX only. Someone could be an expert in  
DOS, but know nothing of UNIX commands. Even for experienced users it can be awkward  
to remember 'a particular' command for accomplishing a specialised purpose. The difference  
with this scenario is that experienced users will be in a better position to find the information  
they need. 
These aspects were considered in the development of the prototype learning algorithm for the  
software agent. A further consideration was the wish to interfere as little as possible with the  
original UNIX X-Windows look and feel. This was so that a user did not need to learn  
'another' interface, but would only need to interact with the software agent. 
Assuming a user has begun a session at a console, the software agent immediately begins by  
observing the user. If the agent sees that the user has not hesitated, but has made a successful  
start, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  
software agent waits in the background continually observing the user's behaviour. This can  
be illustrated as shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: No user hesitation 
If the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  
assistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  
result of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  
situation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  
take control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  
Figure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered 
If though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  
hesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  
This is illustrated in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: Novice UNIX user
The agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  
receiving a request the agent will 'show' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  
is illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help
The agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  
does not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  
happens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  
or that the user is a beginner. The agent also 'bows out gracefully' if upon asking the user  
what they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  
circumstance does not 'insist' on a reply, but returns to 'observing' in the background. 
If a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  
and offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  
Figure 5: 
Figure 5: DOS user
If the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  
though the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  
what the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  
errors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  
trying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters 'pw d', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input 'pwd' and advise that there should be no spaces in 'pwd'. This is a simple  
example, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  
commands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. 
The author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  
was  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  'Software  Agent  
Learning Algorithms above) 'observes' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  
observation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  
composition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  
author, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  
ever correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  
quickly and conveniently. However in the author's experience the most efficient way to enter  
text is to switch off the predictive text input. 
APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS
The idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  
working is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  
philosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  
some  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  
algorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  
would be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  
modified for use in an 'update' to an operator's training (discussed below). 
The paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  
environment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  
simulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  
Piping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  
involving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  
which display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  
together. 
They concluded that 'pattern matching displays', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  
anomalies, but seemed to 'cause' users to make judgements too early on. Instead 'time related'  
information, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to 'cause' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  
tended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  
MDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  
for resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). 
One of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  
simultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  
described above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  
As Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  
happens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  
situation based on the operator's action(s), and on the 'knowledge' it would hold regarding the  
current process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  
UNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  
operators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  
a problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. 
A further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  
situation of a 'plant' converting from a 'hard desk' to a 'soft desk'. This issue of transition is  
discussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face 'a major  
cultural change'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the 'soft  
desk'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that 'soft  
desks' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with 'hard desks'. Furthermore, the  
data is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  
Interface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  
function keys. 
Dicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the 'soft desk', and that after an  
initial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  
based, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  
algorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  
be set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  
the  'soft  desk',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  
screen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  
for information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  
the agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  
initial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  
e.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. 
CONCLUSIONS
The described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  
UNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  
the feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. 'ls  
-l' can be written by novices as 'ls-l'. The software agent has also been developed with the  
option of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it's awkward to turn  
them off, e.g. Microsoft 'paper clip'. 
It has also been partially tested with users who were non UNIX users. The algorithm is  
proving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  
around the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  
training) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  
find the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  
mentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  
prompting a user if they hesitate excessively. 
A negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  
the agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  
inferences based on the user's actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  
agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.

   Notes: A New Software Agent 'Learning' Algorithm 
Pietro Murano 
INTRODUCTION 
This  paper  describes  a  new  software  agent  (Bradshaw  1997)  'learning'  algorithm.  The  
philosophy this new algorithm is based on will also be outlined  in the paper. The new  
algorithm 'observes' a user and, based on the user's action, or lack of actions, will make a set  
of 'inference(s)', and offer the user help/advice appropriate to the user's current situation.  
Furthermore, the algorithm can take into account a user's previous knowledge if this is made  
apparent by a user, while interacting with the system. The algorithm can be tailored in such a  
way that it can be of use to an agent in various virtual environments. The described 'learning'  
algorithm has been implemented with the aim of helping novices get started with UNIX  
commands (Gilly 1994). UNIX commands are typically very difficult for a novice to learn.  
The algorithm could be effectively modified to help novices learn other new interfaces, such  
as those found in command centres and control rooms. Such an algorithm would be a good  
tool in a training environment, as an addition to existing tools. 
To that end this paper will consider: 
? some of the existing related work on learning algorithms, 
? a description of the new algorithm developed, 
? areas where the algorithm could help in a command/control room environment. 
SOFTWARE AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Some algorithms developed for software agents involve the agent 'observing' the user and  
making some kind of 'conclusion' on what the user has done. Then the agent will take some  
action based on this. 
The software agent described in (Lieberman 1995) is such an agent. The aim of the agent is to  
'observe' a user that browses the WWW, and based on the browsing pattern of the user, the  
agent will 'browse' in parallel relevant links. The algorithm incorporates heuristics and a best-
first search. An innovative aspect of this software agent is the fact that a user does not need to  
communicate to the agent their intentions. Instead the agent attempts to discover what the  
user's intentions are by 'observation'. 
In (Lieberman 1997), it is suggested that users at the interface give a system information 'for  
free'. It is advised that this information should be used by the agent to make inferences, with  
the  aim  of  helping  the  user.  Lieberman  further  suggests  that  an  agent,  particularly  an  
autonomous one, can make use of a user's pause time at the interface. 
In (Maes 1994), the idea of an agent 'learning' its behaviour is proposed. The aim is for a  
software agent to 'observe' a user and based on the observation(s), provide appropriate user  
assistance. Maes also allows the option of an agent receiving instructions from the 'human' or  
even to learn from other software agents. A NEW 'LEARNING' ALGORITHM
The new algorithm discussed here, uses a similar philosophy to the types  of algorithms  
discussed by Lieberman and Maes. This new algorithm uses heuristics and 'observes' a user's  
actions. Based on these, the software agent makes 'decisions' or infers how to best assist a  
user.  Furthermore  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  agent  via  Automatic  Speech  
Recognition (ASR). 
The  setting  used  for  the  new  algorithm  was  UNIX  commands.  For  beginners  this  is  a  
notoriously difficult task requiring effort and perseverance. Furthermore, beginners may be  
computing beginners in general or beginners to UNIX only. Someone could be an expert in  
DOS, but know nothing of UNIX commands. Even for experienced users it can be awkward  
to remember 'a particular' command for accomplishing a specialised purpose. The difference  
with this scenario is that experienced users will be in a better position to find the information  
they need. 
These aspects were considered in the development of the prototype learning algorithm for the  
software agent. A further consideration was the wish to interfere as little as possible with the  
original UNIX X-Windows look and feel. This was so that a user did not need to learn  
'another' interface, but would only need to interact with the software agent. 
Assuming a user has begun a session at a console, the software agent immediately begins by  
observing the user. If the agent sees that the user has not hesitated, but has made a successful  
start, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  
software agent waits in the background continually observing the user's behaviour. This can  
be illustrated as shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: No user hesitation 
If the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  
assistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  
result of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  
situation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  
take control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  
Figure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered 
If though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  
hesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  
This is illustrated in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: Novice UNIX user
The agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  
receiving a request the agent will 'show' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  
is illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help
The agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  
does not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  
happens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  
or that the user is a beginner. The agent also 'bows out gracefully' if upon asking the user  
what they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  
circumstance does not 'insist' on a reply, but returns to 'observing' in the background. 
If a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  
and offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  
Figure 5: 
Figure 5: DOS user
If the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  
though the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  
what the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  
errors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  
trying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters 'pw d', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input 'pwd' and advise that there should be no spaces in 'pwd'. This is a simple  
example, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  
commands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. 
The author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  
was  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  'Software  Agent  
Learning Algorithms above) 'observes' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  
observation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  
composition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  
author, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  
ever correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  
quickly and conveniently. However in the author's experience the most efficient way to enter  
text is to switch off the predictive text input. 
APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS
The idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  
working is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  
philosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  
some  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  
algorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  
would be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  
modified for use in an 'update' to an operator's training (discussed below). 
The paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  
environment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  
simulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  
Piping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  
involving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  
which display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  
together. 
They concluded that 'pattern matching displays', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  
anomalies, but seemed to 'cause' users to make judgements too early on. Instead 'time related'  
information, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to 'cause' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  
tended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  
MDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  
for resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). 
One of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  
simultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  
described above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  
As Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  
happens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  
situation based on the operator's action(s), and on the 'knowledge' it would hold regarding the  
current process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  
UNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  
operators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  
a problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. 
A further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  
situation of a 'plant' converting from a 'hard desk' to a 'soft desk'. This issue of transition is  
discussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face 'a major  
cultural change'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the 'soft  
desk'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that 'soft  
desks' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with 'hard desks'. Furthermore, the  
data is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  
Interface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  
function keys. 
Dicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the 'soft desk', and that after an  
initial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  
based, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  
algorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  
be set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  
the  'soft  desk',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  
screen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  
for information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  
the agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  
initial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  
e.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. 
CONCLUSIONS
The described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  
UNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  
the feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. 'ls  
-l' can be written by novices as 'ls-l'. The software agent has also been developed with the  
option of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it's awkward to turn  
them off, e.g. Microsoft 'paper clip'. 
It has also been partially tested with users who were non UNIX users. The algorithm is  
proving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  
around the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  
training) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  
find the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  
mentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  
prompting a user if they hesitate excessively. 
A negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  
the agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  
inferences based on the user's actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  
agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.

start, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  
software agent waits in the background continually observing the user's behaviour. This can  
be illustrated as shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: No user hesitation 
If the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  
assistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  
result of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  
situation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  
take control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  
Figure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered 
If though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  
hesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  
This is illustrated in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: Novice UNIX user
The agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  
receiving a request the agent will 'show' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  
is illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help
The agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  
does not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  
happens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  
or that the user is a beginner. The agent also 'bows out gracefully' if upon asking the user  
what they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  
circumstance does not 'insist' on a reply, but returns to 'observing' in the background. 
If a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  
and offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  
Figure 5: 
Figure 5: DOS user
If the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  
though the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  
what the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  
errors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  
trying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters 'pw d', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input 'pwd' and advise that there should be no spaces in 'pwd'. This is a simple  
example, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  
commands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. 
The author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  
was  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  'Software  Agent  
Learning Algorithms above) 'observes' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  
observation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  
composition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  
author, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  
ever correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  
quickly and conveniently. However in the author's experience the most efficient way to enter  
text is to switch off the predictive text input. 
APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS
The idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  
working is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  
philosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  
some  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  
algorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  
would be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  
modified for use in an 'update' to an operator's training (discussed below). 
The paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  
environment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  
simulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  
Piping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  
involving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  
which display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  
together. 
They concluded that 'pattern matching displays', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  
anomalies, but seemed to 'cause' users to make judgements too early on. Instead 'time related'  
information, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to 'cause' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  
tended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  
MDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  
for resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). 
One of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  
simultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  
described above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  
As Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  
happens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  
situation based on the operator's action(s), and on the 'knowledge' it would hold regarding the  
current process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  
UNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  
operators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  
a problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. 
A further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  
situation of a 'plant' converting from a 'hard desk' to a 'soft desk'. This issue of transition is  
discussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face 'a major  
cultural change'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the 'soft  
desk'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that 'soft  
desks' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with 'hard desks'. Furthermore, the  
data is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  
Interface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  
function keys. 
Dicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the 'soft desk', and that after an  
initial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  
based, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  
algorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  
be set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  
the  'soft  desk',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  
screen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  
for information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  
the agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  
initial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  
e.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. 
CONCLUSIONS
The described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  
UNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  
the feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. 'ls  
-l' can be written by novices as 'ls-l'. The software agent has also been developed with the  
option of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it's awkward to turn  
them off, e.g. Microsoft 'paper clip'. 
It has also been partially tested with users who were non UNIX users. The algorithm is  
proving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  
around the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  
training) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  
find the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  
mentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  
prompting a user if they hesitate excessively. 
A negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  
the agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  
inferences based on the user's actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  
agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.

   Notes: A New Software Agent 'Learning' Algorithm 
Pietro Murano 
INTRODUCTION 
This  paper  describes  a  new  software  agent  (Bradshaw  1997)  'learning'  algorithm.  The  
philosophy this new algorithm is based on will also be outlined  in the paper. The new  
algorithm 'observes' a user and, based on the user's action, or lack of actions, will make a set  
of 'inference(s)', and offer the user help/advice appropriate to the user's current situation.  
Furthermore, the algorithm can take into account a user's previous knowledge if this is made  
apparent by a user, while interacting with the system. The algorithm can be tailored in such a  
way that it can be of use to an agent in various virtual environments. The described 'learning'  
algorithm has been implemented with the aim of helping novices get started with UNIX  
commands (Gilly 1994). UNIX commands are typically very difficult for a novice to learn.  
The algorithm could be effectively modified to help novices learn other new interfaces, such  
as those found in command centres and control rooms. Such an algorithm would be a good  
tool in a training environment, as an addition to existing tools. 
To that end this paper will consider: 
? some of the existing related work on learning algorithms, 
? a description of the new algorithm developed, 
? areas where the algorithm could help in a command/control room environment. 
SOFTWARE AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Some algorithms developed for software agents involve the agent 'observing' the user and  
making some kind of 'conclusion' on what the user has done. Then the agent will take some  
action based on this. 
The software agent described in (Lieberman 1995) is such an agent. The aim of the agent is to  
'observe' a user that browses the WWW, and based on the browsing pattern of the user, the  
agent will 'browse' in parallel relevant links. The algorithm incorporates heuristics and a best-
first search. An innovative aspect of this software agent is the fact that a user does not need to  
communicate to the agent their intentions. Instead the agent attempts to discover what the  
user's intentions are by 'observation'. 
In (Lieberman 1997), it is suggested that users at the interface give a system information 'for  
free'. It is advised that this information should be used by the agent to make inferences, with  
the  aim  of  helping  the  user.  Lieberman  further  suggests  that  an  agent,  particularly  an  
autonomous one, can make use of a user's pause time at the interface. 
In (Maes 1994), the idea of an agent 'learning' its behaviour is proposed. The aim is for a  
software agent to 'observe' a user and based on the observation(s), provide appropriate user  
assistance. Maes also allows the option of an agent receiving instructions from the 'human' or  
even to learn from other software agents. A NEW 'LEARNING' ALGORITHM
The new algorithm discussed here, uses a similar philosophy to the types  of algorithms  
discussed by Lieberman and Maes. This new algorithm uses heuristics and 'observes' a user's  
actions. Based on these, the software agent makes 'decisions' or infers how to best assist a  
user.  Furthermore  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  agent  via  Automatic  Speech  
Recognition (ASR). 
The  setting  used  for  the  new  algorithm  was  UNIX  commands.  For  beginners  this  is  a  
notoriously difficult task requiring effort and perseverance. Furthermore, beginners may be  
computing beginners in general or beginners to UNIX only. Someone could be an expert in  
DOS, but know nothing of UNIX commands. Even for experienced users it can be awkward  
to remember 'a particular' command for accomplishing a specialised purpose. The difference  
with this scenario is that experienced users will be in a better position to find the information  
they need. 
These aspects were considered in the development of the prototype learning algorithm for the  
software agent. A further consideration was the wish to interfere as little as possible with the  
original UNIX X-Windows look and feel. This was so that a user did not need to learn  
'another' interface, but would only need to interact with the software agent. 
Assuming a user has begun a session at a console, the software agent immediately begins by  
observing the user. If the agent sees that the user has not hesitated, but has made a successful  
start, the software agent expects a valid command to be entered. If this is the case, then the  
software agent waits in the background continually observing the user's behaviour. This can  
be illustrated as shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: No user hesitation 
If the next command to be entered by the user is non-existing, then the software agent offers  
assistance, but does not take control. This is because the agent infers that the situation is the  
result of a mistaken key stroke. However at the same time the agent assigns a weight in this  
situation, so that if mistaken key strokes should habitually continue, the agent will eventually  
take control based on the weighting. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and assumes the actions in  
Figure 1 have just taken place: Figure 2: Non-existing command entered 
If though another user should be a complete novice to UNIX and arrives at the interface and  
hesitates excessively, the agent will infer that the user is possibly a novice and take control.  
This is illustrated in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: Novice UNIX user
The agent will then ask the user to input (via the microphone) what they intend to do. Upon  
receiving a request the agent will 'show' the user what to do, to achieve their intentions. This  
is illustrated in Figure 4: Figure 4: User asks agent for help
The agent will then wait to see if the user is following the instructions provided. If the user  
does not follow the instructions the agent will further attempt to help the user. A similar thing  
happens if the user asks the system for help. The agent infers that there is evidently a problem  
or that the user is a beginner. The agent also 'bows out gracefully' if upon asking the user  
what they want to do, the user does not reply but enters a correct command. The agent in this  
circumstance does not 'insist' on a reply, but returns to 'observing' in the background. 
If a user happens to be knowledgeable in DOS and tries to use DOS, the agent detects this  
and offers a translation (if available) to the equivalent UNIX command. This is illustrated in  
Figure 5: 
Figure 5: DOS user
If the user enters the appropriate command, the agent will continue to assist the user. If  
though the user does not return the expected command, the agent will attempt to discover  
what the user is wanting to achieve by asking the user. This behaviour also applies to typing  
errors that a user can do. These would be errors where it could be inferred what the user is  
trying to accomplish, e.g. if the user enters 'pw d', then the agent can infer that the user is  trying to input 'pwd' and advise that there should be no spaces in 'pwd'. This is a simple  
example, but the principle is equally applicable to more complex commands or groups of  
commands where it would be more difficult for a user to see their own mistake. 
The author was eager to ensure that the help given was not annoying, especially as the user  
was  typing.  The  algorithm  in  line  with  the  philosophy  discussed  (see  'Software  Agent  
Learning Algorithms above) 'observes' a user. This means that an inference is made after an  
observation.  Then  help  is  given.  A  contrast  to  this  algorithm  is  the  predictive  text  
composition available in some mobile telephones, e.g. (Nokia 2000). This feature tried by the  
author, in a Nokia telephone, is found to be annoying and the prediction is found to be hardly  
ever correct. The idea is supposed to help a user to enter text (for text messaging) more  
quickly and conveniently. However in the author's experience the most efficient way to enter  
text is to switch off the predictive text input. 
APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM TO OTHER DOMAINS
The idea of software agents being used in a control room environment for co-operative  
working is already being explored, e.g. (Patel, Mitchell et al. 1999). Hence, the principles and  
philosophy discussed above could be used in other domains. All that would be required are  
some  modifications  to  ensure  the  algorithm  is  pertinent  to  the  particular  domain.  The  
algorithm could be implemented to help novices learn new or non-standard interfaces. This  
would be suitable in command centres and control rooms. The algorithm could further be  
modified for use in an 'update' to an operator's training (discussed below). 
The paper by (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999), discusses certain problems in a control room  
environment. This particular experiment was in the context of a coal fired power station  
simulation. Their experiment included different types of interfaces. These were based on  
Piping and Instrumentation (P&I) diagrams. They also used Mass Data Display (MDD) -  
involving a graphical representation comprising of the whole process and Trend Graphs -  
which display the history of a process variable. Combinations of these interfaces were tested  
together. 
They concluded that 'pattern matching displays', e.g. MDD, were faster for detecting process  
anomalies, but seemed to 'cause' users to make judgements too early on. Instead 'time related'  
information, e.g. Trend Graphs, seemed to 'cause' less errors. They also noticed that subjects  
tended to use the MDD interface for categorisation and diagnosis. The problem being that the  
MDD interface was not designed for this purpose. They suggest developing new interfaces  
for resolving some of these problems (Boussoffara and Elzer 1999). 
One of the ways to help this issue would be to have more than one type of interface available  
simultaneously,  to  be  used  collectively.  Furthermore,  an  agent  algorithm  of  the  kind  
described above could be included in such interfaces with the aim of guiding the operators.  
As Boussoffara et al point out, sometimes operators make erroneous judgements. If this  
happens the operator might initiate the wrong action. The agent algorithm could infer this  
situation based on the operator's action(s), and on the 'knowledge' it would hold regarding the  
current process problem. It could then go on to provide assistance in a similar way to the  
UNIX navigation issue described above. Another application the algorithm could have is to use it in a training environment, so that  
operators do not become used to making judgements too early on in the process of diagnosing  
a problem, i.e. it would help an operator to avoid developing bad habits. 
A further situation where the agent algorithm discussed could prove beneficial, is in the  
situation of a 'plant' converting from a 'hard desk' to a 'soft desk'. This issue of transition is  
discussed in (Dicken 1999), and it is stated that the operators in this situation face 'a major  
cultural change'. They discuss various criteria that were considered when designing the 'soft  
desk'. One interesting area was the issue of system navigation. They state the fact that 'soft  
desks' allow for much more data to be accessed compared with 'hard desks'. Furthermore, the  
data is not displayed all at once on a screen. They describe various standard Graphical User  
Interface (GUI) techniques, such as hotspots and buttons. The descriptions also include using  
function keys. 
Dicken acknowledges that operators require training for using the 'soft desk', and that after an  
initial period operators become proficient. Learning to use a new interface whether it is GUI  
based, command based or non standard, requires dedication and effort. The agent learning  
algorithm could be implemented to ease this initial period of learning. A training room could  
be set up where operators in their training cover various scenarios. As they attempt these with  
the  'soft  desk',  the  agent  algorithm  could  guide  the  navigation  to  the  appropriate  
screen/hotspot/virtual control. ASR could be used, where operators could request the agent  
for information. Hence, if an operator cannot remember how to access a particular control,  
the agent could make certain inferences and provide appropriate help. Then the results of this  
initial operator query could be used by the agent to further help the operator with other issues,  
e.g. inferring that it may be difficult for this particular operator to find certain controls. 
CONCLUSIONS
The described algorithm has been developer tested in the UNIX domain, for a sub-set of the  
UNIX commands. The algorithm works well in the described situations. Particularly useful is  
the feature of correcting spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors for known commands, e.g. 'ls  
-l' can be written by novices as 'ls-l'. The software agent has also been developed with the  
option of being switched off. Some agents can become annoying when it's awkward to turn  
them off, e.g. Microsoft 'paper clip'. 
It has also been partially tested with users who were non UNIX users. The algorithm is  
proving itself to be of help to users who would not normally be able to navigate their way  
around the UNIX interface on their own. The algorithm brings the results of (with little  
training) a new user being able to at least get started in using the UNIX commands. Users  
find the spelling/syntax help that the agent gives to be useful, because errors such as those  
mentioned in the previous paragraph are common in new users. The agent is also good for  
prompting a user if they hesitate excessively. 
A negative observation, made during the developer testing and also with novice users, is that  
the agent is more difficult to predict in its actions, because it is trying to make accurate  
inferences based on the user's actions or lack of them. This means that the help given by the  
agent might be different a second time around in an interaction. This is a concern that Ben  
Shneiderman  in  (Bradshaw 1997), uses as a reason  for his scepticism towards software  
agents. It would be interesting and useful for the algorithm described to be implemented in the  
situations described above from the cited research papers. Such an implementation could help  
in training and every day work within a control room or command centre.
