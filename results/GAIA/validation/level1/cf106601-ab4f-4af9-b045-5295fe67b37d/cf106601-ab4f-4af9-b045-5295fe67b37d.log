result of search_wiki: The 1928 Summer Olympics (Dutch: Olympische Zomerspelen 1928), officially the Games of the IX Olympiad (Dutch: Spelen van de IXe Olympiade), was an international multi-sport event that was celebrated from 28 July to 12 August 1928 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The city of Amsterdam had previously bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games. Still, it was obliged to give way to war-torn Antwerp in Belgium for the 1920 Games and Pierre de Coubertin's Paris for the 1924 Games.
The only other candidate city for the 1928 Olympics was Los Angeles, which would eventually be selected to host the Olympics four years later. In preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics, the United States Olympic Committee reviewed the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games.

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Gather general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics (location, dates, participating nations)
   Notes: I've gathered general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics:
- Held in Amsterdam, Netherlands from July 28 to August 12, 1928
- 46 participating nations
- 2,883 total athletes (2,606 men, 277 women)
- First Olympics where women competed in gymnastics and athletics
- Germany returned to Olympic competition after a 16-year absence
- This was the Games of the IX Olympiad
- A symbolic Olympic flame was first lit during these Games
- The protocol of Greece leading the Parade of Nations and host country marching last was established

I've identified potential sources for more detailed information about participating countries and their athlete counts, particularly Olympedia, which appears to be a comprehensive Olympic statistics database.

   Notes: I've gathered general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics:
- Held in Amsterdam, Netherlands from July 28 to August 12, 1928
- 46 participating nations
- 2,883 total athletes (2,606 men, 277 women)
- First Olympics where women competed in gymnastics and athletics
- Germany returned to Olympic competition after a 16-year absence
- This was the Games of the IX Olympiad
- A symbolic Olympic flame was first lit during these Games
- The protocol of Greece leading the Parade of Nations and host country marching last was established

I've identified potential sources for more detailed information about participating countries and their athlete counts, particularly Olympedia, which appears to be a comprehensive Olympic statistics database. This information will be useful for the next step where we need to find reliable sources with complete data on participating countries and their athlete counts.

Plan: Research the country with the least athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics
===============================================================================

Progress: 3/5 steps completed (60.0%)
Status: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Gather general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics (location, dates, participating nations)
   Notes: I've gathered general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics:
- Held in Amsterdam, Netherlands from July 28 to August 12, 1928
- 46 participating nations
- 2,883 total athletes (2,606 men, 277 women)
- First Olympics where women competed in gymnastics and athletics
- Germany returned to Olympic competition after a 16-year absence
- This was the Games of the IX Olympiad
- A symbolic Olympic flame was first lit during these Games
- The protocol of Greece leading the Parade of Nations and host country marching last was established

I've identified potential sources for more detailed information about participating countries and their athlete counts, particularly Olympedia, which appears to be a comprehensive Olympic statistics database. This information will be useful for the next step where we need to find reliable sources with complete data on participating countries and their athlete counts.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research individual participating countries at the 1928 Olympics and compile athlete counts from multiple sources (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I researched the individual participating countries at the 1928 Summer Olympics and compiled their athlete counts. Using Olympedia (https://www.olympedia.org/editions/9/countries), I found a comprehensive list of all 46 participating nations and their respective athlete counts.

Key findings:
1. The minimum number of athletes was 1.
2. Two countries tied with only 1 athlete each: Cuba (CUB) and Panama (PAN).
3. When sorted alphabetically, Cuba (CUB) comes first.
4. I verified Cuba's participation by checking their country-specific page on Olympedia, which confirmed they sent only one athlete (José Barrientos) who competed in athletics.

This data will be used in the next steps to create a comprehensive list of all countries and their athlete counts, and to identify the country with the minimum number of athletes (which we've already determined to be Cuba and Panama, both with 1 athlete each).
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Verify the information about Cuba and Panama having the minimum number of athletes (1 each) (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've verified that Cuba (CUB) and Panama (PAN) were indeed the countries with the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics, with each sending only 1 athlete.

The verification was done through multiple sources:
1. The official Olympedia database (https://www.olympedia.org/editions/9/countries) which lists all participating nations and their athlete counts
2. Individual country pages on Olympedia for both Cuba and Panama, confirming each had only one athlete
3. Biographical information about the specific athletes:
   - José Barrientos from Cuba who competed in athletics (100m)
   - Adán Gordón from Panama who competed in swimming (100m and 400m freestyle)
4. Code analysis of the complete dataset confirming these were the only two countries with the minimum number of athletes (1)

This verification confirms our findings from Step 1 and allows us to proceed with confidence to the next steps.
Details: 
Step3 :[ ] Confirm that Cuba (CUB) is alphabetically first among countries with the minimum number of athletes (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Compile the final answer with the IOC country code (CUB) (depends on: 2, 3)

Plan: Research the country with the least athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics
===============================================================================

Progress: 4/5 steps completed (80.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Gather general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics (location, dates, participating nations)
   Notes: I've gathered general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics:
- Held in Amsterdam, Netherlands from July 28 to August 12, 1928
- 46 participating nations
- 2,883 total athletes (2,606 men, 277 women)
- First Olympics where women competed in gymnastics and athletics
- Germany returned to Olympic competition after a 16-year absence
- This was the Games of the IX Olympiad
- A symbolic Olympic flame was first lit during these Games
- The protocol of Greece leading the Parade of Nations and host country marching last was established

I've identified potential sources for more detailed information about participating countries and their athlete counts, particularly Olympedia, which appears to be a comprehensive Olympic statistics database. This information will be useful for the next step where we need to find reliable sources with complete data on participating countries and their athlete counts.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research individual participating countries at the 1928 Olympics and compile athlete counts from multiple sources (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I researched the individual participating countries at the 1928 Summer Olympics and compiled their athlete counts. Using Olympedia (https://www.olympedia.org/editions/9/countries), I found a comprehensive list of all 46 participating nations and their respective athlete counts.

Key findings:
1. The minimum number of athletes was 1.
2. Two countries tied with only 1 athlete each: Cuba (CUB) and Panama (PAN).
3. When sorted alphabetically, Cuba (CUB) comes first.
4. I verified Cuba's participation by checking their country-specific page on Olympedia, which confirmed they sent only one athlete (José Barrientos) who competed in athletics.

This data will be used in the next steps to create a comprehensive list of all countries and their athlete counts, and to identify the country with the minimum number of athletes (which we've already determined to be Cuba and Panama, both with 1 athlete each).
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Verify the information about Cuba and Panama having the minimum number of athletes (1 each) (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've verified that Cuba (CUB) and Panama (PAN) were indeed the countries with the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics, with each sending only 1 athlete.

The verification was done through multiple sources:
1. The official Olympedia database (https://www.olympedia.org/editions/9/countries) which lists all participating nations and their athlete counts
2. Individual country pages on Olympedia for both Cuba and Panama, confirming each had only one athlete
3. Biographical information about the specific athletes:
   - José Barrientos from Cuba who competed in athletics (100m)
   - Adán Gordón from Panama who competed in swimming (100m and 400m freestyle)
4. Code analysis of the complete dataset confirming these were the only two countries with the minimum number of athletes (1)

This verification confirms our findings from Step 1 and allows us to proceed with confidence to the next steps.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Confirm that Cuba (CUB) is alphabetically first among countries with the minimum number of athletes (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've confirmed that Cuba (CUB) is alphabetically first among countries with the minimum number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

The verification was done through multiple methods:

1. Created a simple code to check the alphabetical order between Cuba and Panama (the two countries previously identified as having the minimum number of athletes).

2. Checked Wikipedia and the Olympedia website (https://www.olympedia.org/editions/9/countries) for comprehensive data on all participating nations.

3. Retrieved and analyzed the complete list of all 46 participating countries and their athlete counts from Olympedia, which confirmed:
   - The minimum number of athletes was 1
   - Only Cuba (CUB) and Panama (PAN) had 1 athlete each
   - When sorted alphabetically, Cuba comes first

4. Verified information about the specific athletes:
   - José Barrientos from Cuba who competed in athletics (100m)
   - Adán Gordón from Panama who competed in swimming (100m and 400m freestyle)

This conclusively confirms that Cuba (CUB) is alphabetically first among countries with the minimum number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics, and its IOC country code is CUB.

===============================================================================

Progress: 5/5 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Gather general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics (location, dates, participating nations)
   Notes: I've gathered general information about the 1928 Summer Olympics:
- Held in Amsterdam, Netherlands from July 28 to August 12, 1928
- 46 participating nations
- 2,883 total athletes (2,606 men, 277 women)
- First Olympics where women competed in gymnastics and athletics
- Germany returned to Olympic competition after a 16-year absence
- This was the Games of the IX Olympiad
- A symbolic Olympic flame was first lit during these Games
- The protocol of Greece leading the Parade of Nations and host country marching last was established

I've identified potential sources for more detailed information about participating countries and their athlete counts, particularly Olympedia, which appears to be a comprehensive Olympic statistics database. This information will be useful for the next step where we need to find reliable sources with complete data on participating countries and their athlete counts.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research individual participating countries at the 1928 Olympics and compile athlete counts from multiple sources (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I researched the individual participating countries at the 1928 Summer Olympics and compiled their athlete counts. Using Olympedia (https://www.olympedia.org/editions/9/countries), I found a comprehensive list of all 46 participating nations and their respective athlete counts.

Key findings:
1. The minimum number of athletes was 1.
2. Two countries tied with only 1 athlete each: Cuba (CUB) and Panama (PAN).
3. When sorted alphabetically, Cuba (CUB) comes first.
4. I verified Cuba's participation by checking their country-specific page on Olympedia, which confirmed they sent only one athlete (José Barrientos) who competed in athletics.

This data will be used in the next steps to create a comprehensive list of all countries and their athlete counts, and to identify the country with the minimum number of athletes (which we've already determined to be Cuba and Panama, both with 1 athlete each).
