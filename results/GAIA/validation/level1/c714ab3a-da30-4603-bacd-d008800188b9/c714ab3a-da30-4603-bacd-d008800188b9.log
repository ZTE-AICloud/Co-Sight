re-plan_result is I'll continue with the existing plan, which is well-structured for solving this logical puzzle. Let me proceed with the next steps.

Let me analyze the statement made by all residents and determine what it means when said by humans versus vampires.

If a human says "At least one of us is a human" - this is true (since humans tell the truth).
If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human" - this must be false (since vampires always lie). This means "None of us is a human" or "All of us are vampires" would be true.

Since everyone in the village gave the same response, we have two possibilities:
1. All residents are humans (they all tell the truth)
2. All residents are vampires (they all lie)

But if all residents were vampires, they would be saying something false when claiming "At least one of us is a human." This statement would actually be false (since all would be vampires), which means vampires would indeed say this (as they always lie).

If all residents were humans, they would be telling the truth with this statement, which is consistent with humans always telling the truth.

So both scenarios (all humans or all vampires) are logically consistent with everyone giving the same answer.

However, we know for certain there is at least one vampire in the village because Van Helsing witnessed one. This eliminates the "all humans" possibility.

Therefore, all 100 residents must be vampires.

re-plan_result is I'll continue with the logical deduction based on our analysis so far.

Let's apply logical deduction to find the number of vampires:

We've established that everyone in the village gave the same response: "At least one of us is a human."

For humans (who tell the truth):
- If a human says this statement, it must be true that at least one resident is human.

For vampires (who always lie):
- If a vampire says this statement, it must be false, meaning "None of us is human" or "All of us are vampires" is true.

Since everyone gave the same answer, we have two possibilities:
1. All residents are humans (all telling the truth)
2. All residents are vampires (all lying)

However, we know for certain there is at least one vampire in the village because Van Helsing witnessed one. This eliminates the possibility that all residents are humans.

Therefore, all 100 residents must be vampires. This is the only logically consistent answer given the constraints.

Let me verify this solution:
- If all 100 residents are vampires, they would all lie.
- When they say "At least one of us is a human," they are lying.
- The truth is therefore "None of us is human" or "All of us are vampires."
- This is consistent with our conclusion.

The answer is 100.

Plan: Solve the Vampire Logic Puzzle
=====================================

Progress: 4/6 steps completed (66.7%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the key facts and constraints of the problem
   Notes: Identified key facts and constraints:
1. 100 residents in the village.
2. Humans always tell the truth.
3. Vampires always lie.
4. All residents claim 'At least one of us is a human.'

Next step is to analyze the statement made by all residents.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Analyze the statement made by all residents (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Analyzed the statement:
- Humans telling the truth and vampires lying creates a contradiction unless all are vampires.
- Concluded that all residents being vampires is the only consistent scenario.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Determine what this statement would mean if said by humans vs. vampires (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Analyzed the statement for both humans and vampires:
- Humans saying 'At least one of us is a human' confirms the presence of at least one human.
- Vampires saying the same implies 'None of us is a human,' meaning all are vampires.
Concluded that the only consistent scenario is all residents being vampires.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Apply logical deduction to find the number of vampires (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Applied logical deduction:
- Summarized key points.
- Deduced that the only consistent scenario is all residents being vampires.
- Concluded that the number of vampires is 100.

【create_with_tools】 [0] response is ChatCompletionMessage(content='To verify the solution with a consistency check, let\'s revisit the logical deductions made so far:\n\n1. All residents in the village of ?irnea claim: "At least one of us is a human."\n2. Humans always tell the truth.\n3. Vampires always lie.\n\nGiven these constraints, if there were any humans in the village, their truthful statement would be correct, implying that there is at least one human among them. However, this creates a contradiction because vampires, who always lie, would also then be stating a truth when they say "At least one of us is a human." Hence, the only consistent scenario without contradiction is that all residents are vampires.\n\nTherefore, if all residents are vampires, their statement "At least one of us is a human" is indeed a lie, which aligns with the rule that vampires always lie. This confirms that there are no humans in the village, and thus, all 100 residents must be vampires.\n\nConclusion from consistency check:\n- If all residents are vampires, the statement made by each resident aligns perfectly with the rules: humans (if present) telling the truth and vampires lying.\n\nTherefore, the solution remains consistent under this check.
