Steps:
Step0 :[?] Open and read the provided document file
   Notes: Successfully extracted the content from the document. The document contains:
1. A list of all 12 employees: Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex
2. A gift assignment table showing who was assigned to give a gift to whom
3. Profiles for each employee listing their three interests/hobbies
4. A list of the 11 gifts that were actually given

This information will be used in the next steps to determine who did not give their assigned gift.
Step1 :[?] Extract information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa. Here's a summary:

1. Total employees: 12 (Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex)

2. Each employee's interests:
   - Harry: Fishing, Camping, Wine
   - Rebecca: Cars, Dogs, Chocolate
   - Georgette: Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy
   - Micah: Knitting, Rainy Weather, Books

   - Georgette → Lucy
   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Sara
   - Fred → Rebecca

Step2 :[ ] Create a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Identify all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them (depends on: 1)
Step4 :[ ] Determine which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so (depends on: 2, 3)
Step5 :[ ] Verify the answer by cross-checking all available information (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Formulate the final answer as a single name without articles or abbreviations (depends on: 5)

Plan: Analyze Secret Santa Document to Identify Missing Gift-Giver
===================================================================

Progress: 3/7 steps completed (42.9%)
Status: 3 completed, 1 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Open and read the provided document file
   Notes: Successfully extracted the content from the document. The document contains:
1. A list of all 12 employees: Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex
2. A gift assignment table showing who was assigned to give a gift to whom
3. Profiles for each employee listing their three interests/hobbies
4. A list of the 11 gifts that were actually given

This information will be used in the next steps to determine who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Extract information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa. Here's a summary:

1. Total employees: 12 (Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex)

2. Each employee's interests:
   - Harry: Fishing, Camping, Wine
   - Rebecca: Cars, Dogs, Chocolate
   - Georgette: Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy
   - Micah: Knitting, Rainy Weather, Books

   - Tyson: Historical Fiction Novels, Biking, Parakeets
   - Lucy: Coffee, Physics, Board Games
   - Jun: Woodworking, Barbecue, JavaScript
   - Sara: Tabletop RPGs, Spas, Music
   - Miguel: Astronomy, Decorative Washi Tape, Ketchup
   - Fred: Chemistry, Perl, Cats
   - Alex: Surfing, Audrey Hepburn, Manga

3. Gift assignments (who was assigned to give a gift to whom):
   - Harry → Miguel
   - Rebecca → Micah
   - Georgette → Lucy
   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Sara
   - Fred → Rebecca
   - Alex → Tyson

4. Gifts that were given (11 total):
   - Galileo Galilei biography

   - Foam exercise mat

5. Key observation: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, confirming that one person did not give their assigned gift.

This information will be used in the next steps to create a tracking table and determine who did not give their gift.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Create a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully created a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients. The table matches each gift to its likely recipient based on the recipient's interests, and then identifies who was assigned to give that gift.

The tracking table includes:
1. Each gift that was given
2. The likely recipient of each gift (based on their interests)
3. The specific interest that matches the gift
4. The person who was assigned to give a gift to that recipient

Plan: Analyze Secret Santa Document to Identify Missing Gift-Giver
===================================================================

Progress: 4/7 steps completed (57.1%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Open and read the provided document file
   Notes: Successfully extracted the content from the document. The document contains:
1. A list of all 12 employees: Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex
2. A gift assignment table showing who was assigned to give a gift to whom
3. Profiles for each employee listing their three interests/hobbies
4. A list of the 11 gifts that were actually given

This information will be used in the next steps to determine who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Extract information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa. Here's a summary:

1. Total employees: 12 (Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex)

2. Each employee's interests:
   - Harry: Fishing, Camping, Wine
   - Rebecca: Cars, Dogs, Chocolate
   - Georgette: Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy
   - Micah: Knitting, Rainy Weather, Books
   - Perry: Old Movies, Rats, Journaling
   - Tyson: Historical Fiction Novels, Biking, Parakeets
   - Lucy: Coffee, Physics, Board Games
   - Jun: Woodworking, Barbecue, JavaScript
   - Sara: Tabletop RPGs, Spas, Music
   - Miguel: Astronomy, Decorative Washi Tape, Ketchup
   - Fred: Chemistry, Perl, Cats
   - Alex: Surfing, Audrey Hepburn, Manga

3. Gift assignments (who was assigned to give a gift to whom):
   - Harry → Miguel
   - Rebecca → Micah
   - Georgette → Lucy
   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Sara
   - Fred → Rebecca
   - Alex → Tyson

4. Gifts that were given (11 total):
   - Galileo Galilei biography
   - Fishing reel
   - Raku programming guide
   - Chisel set
   - Custom dice
   - "War and Peace" American film copy
   - Yarn
   - "One Piece" graphic novel
   - "War and Peace" novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

5. Key observation: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, confirming that one person did not give their assigned gift.

This information will be used in the next steps to create a tracking table and determine who did not give their gift.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Create a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully created a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients. The table matches each gift to its likely recipient based on the recipient's interests, and then identifies who was assigned to give that gift.

The tracking table includes:
1. Each gift that was given
2. The likely recipient of each gift (based on their interests)
3. The specific interest that matches the gift
4. The person who was assigned to give a gift to that recipient

Key findings from the tracking table:
- All 11 gifts can be matched to recipients based on their interests
- Each of the 12 employees was assigned to give a gift to another employee
- Based on the tracking table, Fred is the only employee who does not appear as an assigned giver for any of the gifts that were given

This tracking table will be used in the next steps to identify who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have successfully identified all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them. By matching each gift to the recipient's interests and cross-referencing with the gift assignment table, I was able to determine:

1. All eleven gifts and their givers:
   - Galileo Galilei biography → Miguel (from Harry) - matches Miguel's interest in Astronomy
   - Fishing reel → Harry (from Jun) - matches Harry's interest in Fishing
   - Raku programming guide → Fred (from Tyson) - matches Fred's interest in Perl (programming)
   - Chisel set → Jun (from Micah) - matches Jun's interest in Woodworking
   - Custom dice → Sara (from Miguel) - matches Sara's interest in Tabletop RPGs
   - "War and Peace" American film copy → Perry (from Sara) - matches Perry's interest in Old Movies
   - Yarn → Micah (from Rebecca) - matches Micah's interest in Knitting
   - "One Piece" graphic novel → Alex (from Lucy) - matches Alex's interest in Manga
   - "War and Peace" novel → Tyson (from Alex) - matches Tyson's interest in Historical Fiction Novels
   - Starbucks gift card → Lucy (from Georgette) - matches Lucy's interest in Coffee
   - Foam exercise mat → Georgette (from Perry) - matches Georgette's interest in Yoga

2. Key finding: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given. By analyzing who gave gifts, I found that Fred did not give a gift.

3. Verification: Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate), but no gift matching Rebecca's interests was given.

This analysis confirms that Fred was the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step4 :[ ] Determine which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so (depends on: 2, 3)
Step5 :[ ] Verify the answer by cross-checking all available information (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Formulate the final answer as a single name without articles or abbreviations (depends on: 5)

5. Key observation: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, confirming that one person did not give their assigned gift.

This information will be used in the next steps to create a tracking table and determine who did not give their gift.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Create a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully created a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients. The table matches each gift to its likely recipient based on the recipient's interests, and then identifies who was assigned to give that gift.

The tracking table includes:
1. Each gift that was given
2. The likely recipient of each gift (based on their interests)
3. The specific interest that matches the gift
4. The person who was assigned to give a gift to that recipient

Key findings from the tracking table:
- All 11 gifts can be matched to recipients based on their interests
- Each of the 12 employees was assigned to give a gift to another employee
- Based on the tracking table, Fred is the only employee who does not appear as an assigned giver for any of the gifts that were given

This tracking table will be used in the next steps to identify who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have successfully identified all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them. By matching each gift to the recipient's interests and cross-referencing with the gift assignment table, I was able to determine:

1. All eleven gifts and their givers:
   - Galileo Galilei biography → Miguel (from Harry) - matches Miguel's interest in Astronomy
   - Fishing reel → Harry (from Jun) - matches Harry's interest in Fishing
   - Raku programming guide → Fred (from Tyson) - matches Fred's interest in Perl (programming)
   - Chisel set → Jun (from Micah) - matches Jun's interest in Woodworking
   - Custom dice → Sara (from Miguel) - matches Sara's interest in Tabletop RPGs
   - "War and Peace" American film copy → Perry (from Sara) - matches Perry's interest in Old Movies
   - Yarn → Micah (from Rebecca) - matches Micah's interest in Knitting
   - "One Piece" graphic novel → Alex (from Lucy) - matches Alex's interest in Manga
   - "War and Peace" novel → Tyson (from Alex) - matches Tyson's interest in Historical Fiction Novels
   - Starbucks gift card → Lucy (from Georgette) - matches Lucy's interest in Coffee
   - Foam exercise mat → Georgette (from Perry) - matches Georgette's interest in Yoga

2. Key finding: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given. By analyzing who gave gifts, I found that Fred did not give a gift.

3. Verification: Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate), but no gift matching Rebecca's interests was given.

This analysis confirms that Fred was the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Determine which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so (depends on: 2, 3)
   Notes: I have successfully determined which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so. By analyzing the gift tracking table and cross-referencing the gift assignments with the gifts that were actually given, I found that:

1. Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate)
2. No gift matching Rebecca's interests was found among the 11 gifts that were given
3. All other employees can be matched as having given their assigned gifts

The complete gift tracking table shows:
- 11 gifts were given in total (out of 12 expected)
- Each gift matches one of the recipient's interests
- 11 employees can be identified as having given their assigned gifts
- Fred is the only employee who does not appear as a gift-giver in the tracking table

Therefore, Fred is the employee who did not give their assigned gift.

Plan: Analyze Secret Santa Document to Identify Missing Gift-Giver
===================================================================

Progress: 6/7 steps completed (85.7%)
Status: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Open and read the provided document file
   Notes: Successfully extracted the content from the document. The document contains:
1. A list of all 12 employees: Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex
2. A gift assignment table showing who was assigned to give a gift to whom
3. Profiles for each employee listing their three interests/hobbies
4. A list of the 11 gifts that were actually given

This information will be used in the next steps to determine who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Extract information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa. Here's a summary:

1. Total employees: 12 (Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex)

2. Each employee's interests:
   - Harry: Fishing, Camping, Wine
   - Rebecca: Cars, Dogs, Chocolate
   - Georgette: Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy
   - Micah: Knitting, Rainy Weather, Books
   - Perry: Old Movies, Rats, Journaling
   - Tyson: Historical Fiction Novels, Biking, Parakeets
   - Lucy: Coffee, Physics, Board Games
   - Jun: Woodworking, Barbecue, JavaScript
   - Sara: Tabletop RPGs, Spas, Music
   - Miguel: Astronomy, Decorative Washi Tape, Ketchup
   - Fred: Chemistry, Perl, Cats
   - Alex: Surfing, Audrey Hepburn, Manga

3. Gift assignments (who was assigned to give a gift to whom):
   - Harry → Miguel
   - Rebecca → Micah
   - Georgette → Lucy
   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Sara
   - Fred → Rebecca
   - Alex → Tyson

4. Gifts that were given (11 total):
   - Galileo Galilei biography
   - Fishing reel
   - Raku programming guide
   - Chisel set
   - Custom dice
   - "War and Peace" American film copy
   - Yarn
   - "One Piece" graphic novel
   - "War and Peace" novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

5. Key observation: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, confirming that one person did not give their assigned gift.

This information will be used in the next steps to create a tracking table and determine who did not give their gift.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Create a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully created a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients. The table matches each gift to its likely recipient based on the recipient's interests, and then identifies who was assigned to give that gift.

The tracking table includes:
1. Each gift that was given
2. The likely recipient of each gift (based on their interests)
3. The specific interest that matches the gift
4. The person who was assigned to give a gift to that recipient

Key findings from the tracking table:
- All 11 gifts can be matched to recipients based on their interests
- Each of the 12 employees was assigned to give a gift to another employee
- Based on the tracking table, Fred is the only employee who does not appear as an assigned giver for any of the gifts that were given

This tracking table will be used in the next steps to identify who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have successfully identified all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them. By matching each gift to the recipient's interests and cross-referencing with the gift assignment table, I was able to determine:

1. All eleven gifts and their givers:
   - Galileo Galilei biography → Miguel (from Harry) - matches Miguel's interest in Astronomy
   - Fishing reel → Harry (from Jun) - matches Harry's interest in Fishing
   - Raku programming guide → Fred (from Tyson) - matches Fred's interest in Perl (programming)
   - Chisel set → Jun (from Micah) - matches Jun's interest in Woodworking
   - Custom dice → Sara (from Miguel) - matches Sara's interest in Tabletop RPGs
   - "War and Peace" American film copy → Perry (from Sara) - matches Perry's interest in Old Movies
   - Yarn → Micah (from Rebecca) - matches Micah's interest in Knitting
   - "One Piece" graphic novel → Alex (from Lucy) - matches Alex's interest in Manga
   - "War and Peace" novel → Tyson (from Alex) - matches Tyson's interest in Historical Fiction Novels
   - Starbucks gift card → Lucy (from Georgette) - matches Lucy's interest in Coffee
   - Foam exercise mat → Georgette (from Perry) - matches Georgette's interest in Yoga

2. Key finding: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given. By analyzing who gave gifts, I found that Fred did not give a gift.

3. Verification: Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate), but no gift matching Rebecca's interests was given.

This analysis confirms that Fred was the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Determine which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so (depends on: 2, 3)
   Notes: I have successfully determined which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so. By analyzing the gift tracking table and cross-referencing the gift assignments with the gifts that were actually given, I found that:

1. Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate)
2. No gift matching Rebecca's interests was found among the 11 gifts that were given
3. All other employees can be matched as having given their assigned gifts

The complete gift tracking table shows:
- 11 gifts were given in total (out of 12 expected)
- Each gift matches one of the recipient's interests
- 11 employees can be identified as having given their assigned gifts
- Fred is the only employee who does not appear as a gift-giver in the tracking table

Therefore, Fred is the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Verify the answer by cross-checking all available information (depends on: 4)
   Notes: I have thoroughly verified the answer by cross-checking all available information in the document. The verification confirms that:

1. There were 12 employees participating in the Secret Santa exchange.
2. Each employee was assigned to give a gift to one other employee.
3. Only 11 gifts were actually given, each matching one of the recipient's interests.
4. By analyzing the gift assignments and matching each gift to its likely recipient based on interests, I found that:
   - All employees except Fred can be confirmed as having given their assigned gifts
   - Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca
   - No gift matching Rebecca's interests (Cars, Dogs, Chocolate) was given
   - Rebecca did not receive a gift, confirming that Fred did not give his assigned gift

Multiple verification approaches all lead to the same conclusion: Fred is the employee who did not give a gift in the Secret Santa exchange.

This verification is complete and consistent with all the information provided in the document.

Plan: Analyze Secret Santa Document to Identify Missing Gift-Giver
===================================================================

Progress: 6/7 steps completed (85.7%)
Status: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Open and read the provided document file
   Notes: Successfully extracted the content from the document. The document contains:
1. A list of all 12 employees: Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex
2. A gift assignment table showing who was assigned to give a gift to whom
3. Profiles for each employee listing their three interests/hobbies
4. A list of the 11 gifts that were actually given

This information will be used in the next steps to determine who did not give their assigned gift.
Step1 :[?] Extract information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa. Here's a summary:

1. Total employees: 12 (Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex)

2. Each employee's interests:
   - Harry: Fishing, Camping, Wine
   - Rebecca: Cars, Dogs, Chocolate
   - Georgette: Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy
   - Micah: Knitting, Rainy Weather, Books
   - Perry: Old Movies, Rats, Journaling
   - Tyson: Historical Fiction Novels, Biking, Parakeets
   - Lucy: Coffee, Physics, Board Games
   - Jun: Woodworking, Barbecue, JavaScript
   - Sara: Tabletop RPGs, Spas, Music
   - Miguel: Astronomy, Decorative Washi Tape, Ketchup
   - Fred: Chemistry, Perl, Cats
   - Alex: Surfing, Audrey Hepburn, Manga

3. Gift assignments (who was assigned to give a gift to whom):
   - Harry → Miguel
   - Rebecca → Micah
   - Georgette → Lucy
   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Sara
   - Fred → Rebecca
   - Alex → Tyson

4. Gifts that were given (11 total):
   - Galileo Galilei biography
   - Fishing reel
   - Raku programming guide
   - Chisel set
   - Custom dice
   - "War and Peace" American film copy
   - Yarn
   - "One Piece" graphic novel
   - "War and Peace" novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

5. Key observation: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, confirming that one person did not give their assigned gift.

This information will be used in the next steps to create a tracking table and determine who did not give their gift.
Step2 :[?] Create a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully created a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients. The table matches each gift to its likely recipient based on the recipient's interests, and then identifies who was assigned to give that gift.

The tracking table includes:
1. Each gift that was given
2. The likely recipient of each gift (based on their interests)
3. The specific interest that matches the gift
4. The person who was assigned to give a gift to that recipient

Key findings from the tracking table:
- All 11 gifts can be matched to recipients based on their interests
- Each of the 12 employees was assigned to give a gift to another employee
- Based on the tracking table, Fred is the only employee who does not appear as an assigned giver for any of the gifts that were given

This tracking table will be used in the next steps to identify who did not give their assigned gift.
Step3 :[?] Identify all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have successfully identified all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them. By matching each gift to the recipient's interests and cross-referencing with the gift assignment table, I was able to determine:

1. All eleven gifts and their givers:
   - Galileo Galilei biography → Miguel (from Harry) - matches Miguel's interest in Astronomy
   - Fishing reel → Harry (from Jun) - matches Harry's interest in Fishing
   - Raku programming guide → Fred (from Tyson) - matches Fred's interest in Perl (programming)
   - Chisel set → Jun (from Micah) - matches Jun's interest in Woodworking
   - Custom dice → Sara (from Miguel) - matches Sara's interest in Tabletop RPGs
   - "War and Peace" American film copy → Perry (from Sara) - matches Perry's interest in Old Movies
   - Yarn → Micah (from Rebecca) - matches Micah's interest in Knitting
   - "One Piece" graphic novel → Alex (from Lucy) - matches Alex's interest in Manga
   - "War and Peace" novel → Tyson (from Alex) - matches Tyson's interest in Historical Fiction Novels
   - Starbucks gift card → Lucy (from Georgette) - matches Lucy's interest in Coffee
   - Foam exercise mat → Georgette (from Perry) - matches Georgette's interest in Yoga

2. Key finding: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given. By analyzing who gave gifts, I found that Fred did not give a gift.

3. Verification: Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate), but no gift matching Rebecca's interests was given.

This analysis confirms that Fred was the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Step4 :[?] Determine which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so (depends on: 2, 3)
   Notes: I have successfully determined which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so. By analyzing the gift tracking table and cross-referencing the gift assignments with the gifts that were actually given, I found that:

1. Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate)
2. No gift matching Rebecca's interests was found among the 11 gifts that were given
3. All other employees can be matched as having given their assigned gifts

The complete gift tracking table shows:
- 11 gifts were given in total (out of 12 expected)
- Each gift matches one of the recipient's interests
- 11 employees can be identified as having given their assigned gifts
- Fred is the only employee who does not appear as a gift-giver in the tracking table

Therefore, Fred is the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Step5 :[?] Verify the answer by cross-checking all available information (depends on: 4)
   Notes: I have thoroughly verified the answer by cross-checking all available information in the document. The verification confirms that:

1. There were 12 employees participating in the Secret Santa exchange.
2. Each employee was assigned to give a gift to one other employee.
3. Only 11 gifts were actually given, each matching one of the recipient's interests.
4. By analyzing the gift assignments and matching each gift to its likely recipient based on interests, I found that:
   - All employees except Fred can be confirmed as having given their assigned gifts
   - Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca
   - No gift matching Rebecca's interests (Cars, Dogs, Chocolate) was given
   - Rebecca did not receive a gift, confirming that Fred did not give his assigned gift

Multiple verification approaches all lead to the same conclusion: Fred is the employee who did not give a gift in the Secret Santa exchange.

This verification is complete and consistent with all the information provided in the document.
Step6 :[ ] Formulate the final answer as a single name without articles or abbreviations (depends on: 5)

Plan: Analyze Secret Santa Document to Identify Missing Gift-Giver
===================================================================

Progress: 7/7 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Open and read the provided document file
   Notes: Successfully extracted the content from the document. The document contains:
1. A list of all 12 employees: Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex
2. A gift assignment table showing who was assigned to give a gift to whom
3. Profiles for each employee listing their three interests/hobbies
4. A list of the 11 gifts that were actually given

This information will be used in the next steps to determine who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Extract information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted information about all twelve employees participating in the Secret Santa. Here's a summary:

1. Total employees: 12 (Harry, Rebecca, Georgette, Micah, Perry, Tyson, Lucy, Jun, Sara, Miguel, Fred, and Alex)

2. Each employee's interests:
   - Harry: Fishing, Camping, Wine
   - Rebecca: Cars, Dogs, Chocolate
   - Georgette: Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy
   - Micah: Knitting, Rainy Weather, Books
   - Perry: Old Movies, Rats, Journaling
   - Tyson: Historical Fiction Novels, Biking, Parakeets
   - Lucy: Coffee, Physics, Board Games
   - Jun: Woodworking, Barbecue, JavaScript
   - Sara: Tabletop RPGs, Spas, Music
   - Miguel: Astronomy, Decorative Washi Tape, Ketchup
   - Fred: Chemistry, Perl, Cats
   - Alex: Surfing, Audrey Hepburn, Manga

3. Gift assignments (who was assigned to give a gift to whom):
   - Harry → Miguel
   - Rebecca → Micah
   - Georgette → Lucy
   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Sara
   - Fred → Rebecca
   - Alex → Tyson

4. Gifts that were given (11 total):
   - Galileo Galilei biography
   - Fishing reel
   - Raku programming guide
   - Chisel set
   - Custom dice
   - "War and Peace" American film copy
   - Yarn
   - "One Piece" graphic novel
   - "War and Peace" novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

5. Key observation: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, confirming that one person did not give their assigned gift.

This information will be used in the next steps to create a tracking table and determine who did not give their gift.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Create a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully created a tracking table of gift-givers and recipients. The table matches each gift to its likely recipient based on the recipient's interests, and then identifies who was assigned to give that gift.

The tracking table includes:
1. Each gift that was given
2. The likely recipient of each gift (based on their interests)
3. The specific interest that matches the gift
4. The person who was assigned to give a gift to that recipient

Key findings from the tracking table:
- All 11 gifts can be matched to recipients based on their interests
- Each of the 12 employees was assigned to give a gift to another employee
- Based on the tracking table, Fred is the only employee who does not appear as an assigned giver for any of the gifts that were given

This tracking table will be used in the next steps to identify who did not give their assigned gift.

Step3 :[?] Identify all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have successfully identified all eleven gifts that were given and who gave them. By matching each gift to the recipient's interests and cross-referencing with the gift assignment table, I was able to determine:

1. All eleven gifts and their givers:
   - Galileo Galilei biography → Miguel (from Harry) - matches Miguel's interest in Astronomy
   - Fishing reel → Harry (from Jun) - matches Harry's interest in Fishing
   - Raku programming guide → Fred (from Tyson) - matches Fred's interest in Perl (programming)
   - Chisel set → Jun (from Micah) - matches Jun's interest in Woodworking
   - Custom dice → Sara (from Miguel) - matches Sara's interest in Tabletop RPGs
   - "War and Peace" American film copy → Perry (from Sara) - matches Perry's interest in Old Movies
   - Yarn → Micah (from Rebecca) - matches Micah's interest in Knitting
   - "One Piece" graphic novel → Alex (from Lucy) - matches Alex's interest in Manga
   - "War and Peace" novel → Tyson (from Alex) - matches Tyson's interest in Historical Fiction Novels
   - Starbucks gift card → Lucy (from Georgette) - matches Lucy's interest in Coffee
   - Foam exercise mat → Georgette (from Perry) - matches Georgette's interest in Yoga

2. Key finding: There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given. By analyzing who gave gifts, I found that Fred did not give a gift.

3. Verification: Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate), but no gift matching Rebecca's interests was given.

This analysis confirms that Fred was the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Determine which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so (depends on: 2, 3)
   Notes: I have successfully determined which employee was assigned to give a gift but did not do so. By analyzing the gift tracking table and cross-referencing the gift assignments with the gifts that were actually given, I found that:

1. Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (whose interests are Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate)
2. No gift matching Rebecca's interests was found among the 11 gifts that were given
3. All other employees can be matched as having given their assigned gifts

The complete gift tracking table shows:
- 11 gifts were given in total (out of 12 expected)
- Each gift matches one of the recipient's interests
- 11 employees can be identified as having given their assigned gifts
- Fred is the only employee who does not appear as a gift-giver in the tracking table

Therefore, Fred is the employee who did not give their assigned gift.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Verify the answer by cross-checking all available information (depends on: 4)
   Notes: I have thoroughly verified the answer by cross-checking all available information in the document. The verification confirms that:

1. There were 12 employees participating in the Secret Santa exchange.
2. Each employee was assigned to give a gift to one other employee.
3. Only 11 gifts were actually given, each matching one of the recipient's interests.
4. By analyzing the gift assignments and matching each gift to its likely recipient based on interests, I found that:
   - All employees except Fred can be confirmed as having given their assigned gifts
   - Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca
   - No gift matching Rebecca's interests (Cars, Dogs, Chocolate) was given
   - Rebecca did not receive a gift, confirming that Fred did not give his assigned gift

Multiple verification approaches all lead to the same conclusion: Fred is the employee who did not give a gift in the Secret Santa exchange.

This verification is complete and consistent with all the information provided in the document.
Details: 
Step6 :[?] Formulate the final answer as a single name without articles or abbreviations (depends on: 5)
   Notes: I have formulated the final answer based on a thorough analysis of the document. By creating a tracking table that matched each gift to its recipient based on their interests and identifying who was assigned to give each gift, I determined that Fred was the employee who did not give a gift.

The analysis showed:
1. There were 12 employees but only 11 gifts given
2. Each gift matched one of the recipient's interests
3. Fred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca
4. No gift matching Rebecca's interests (Cars, Dogs, Chocolate) was given
5. All other employees can be confirmed as having given their assigned gifts

Therefore, the final answer is: Fred
