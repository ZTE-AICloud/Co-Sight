re-plan_result is I see that Step 3 is marked as blocked, but we have all the information needed to provide the answer. According to the original task instructions, I should return only the numerical answer without any units.

Based on the completed steps, we've determined:
- BERT base encoder has 12 blocks/layers
- The encoder from "Attention is All You Need" has 6 blocks/layers
- The difference is 6 more blocks in BERT base

Following the instructions to return only the number without any units:
