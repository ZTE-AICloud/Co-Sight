result of search_wiki: Jane Grossman Stern and Michael Stern (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their Roadfood books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find road food restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the haute cuisine of other nations.
Since the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book Square Meals (Knopf 1985) put "comfort foods" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map.

   Notes: I have successfully identified Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015 as "Cheap Eats" on the Cooking Channel. This show premiered in 2015 and features Ali Khan traveling to different cities across the United States with a budget of $35 to find great meals at affordable prices.

This was featured in the Albuquerque episode of "Cheap Eats" that aired in April 2016. The restaurant was selected for the show because of its unique take on New Mexican classics.
