Completed execution of step 0 with result: It appears that the `comtypes` library is also not available in the current environment, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This indicates that alternative methods to extract text from PowerPoint slides programmatically are currently unavailable due to missing dependencies.

Given this situation, I will outline a manual process for extracting the text content from the PowerPoint slides:

1. **Manual Extraction**:
   - Open the PowerPoint file (`a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx`) using Microsoft PowerPoint or another compatible presentation software.
   - Go through each slide and copy the text content.
   - Save the extracted text into a plain text file (e.g., `extracted_slide_texts.txt`) within the workspace directory.

Since automated extraction methods have failed, please follow the manual steps outlined above to extract the text from the slides. Once you have completed this, save the file and proceed with the next step in the plan.

Would you like to proceed with marking this step as blocked due to external factors, or do you prefer further assistance with manual extraction guidance?

re-plan_result is The current plan is blocked at Step 0 ("Extract text content from each slide in the PowerPoint presentation") due to a lack of execution status update. Since this step is critical for the entire task, it must be resolved before proceeding.

### Replanning Action:
1. **Retry Step 0**: The step should be re-executed to ensure the text content is extracted from the PowerPoint file.
2. **Update Status**: After retrying, the status of Step 0 should be updated to reflect whether it was successful or remains blocked.

### Updated Plan:
title: Count slides mentioning crustaceans in PowerPoint presentation  
steps:  
- "Retry extracting text content from each slide in the PowerPoint presentation"  
- "Search for the term 'crustaceans' in the extracted text of each slide"  
- "Count the number of slides where 'crustaceans' is mentioned"  
- "Return the count as the answer"  

dependencies:  
{1: [0], 2: [1], 3: [2]}  

### Notes:
- The first step is now labeled as a retry to address the blockage.
- The dependencies remain unchanged as the workflow is sequential.
