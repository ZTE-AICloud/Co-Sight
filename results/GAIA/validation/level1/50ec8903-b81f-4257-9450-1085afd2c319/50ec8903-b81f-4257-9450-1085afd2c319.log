Plan: Determine the Missing Two-Colored Cube from a Rubik's Cube
=================================================================

Progress: 2/5 steps completed (40.0%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Understand the structure of a standard Rubik's cube
   Notes: I've analyzed the structure of a standard Rubik's cube:

1. A standard Rubik's cube is a 3x3x3 cube with 6 faces/sides, each with a different color: white, yellow, blue, green, red, and orange.

2. The cube consists of:
   - 6 center cubes (one on each face, each with 1 colored face)
   - 12 edge cubes (each with 2 colored faces)
   - 8 corner cubes (each with 3 colored faces)
   - Total visible cubelets: 26

3. The opposite faces on a standard Rubik's cube are:
   - White is opposite Yellow
   - Blue is opposite Green
   - Red is opposite Orange

4. The center cubes are fixed in relation to each other and determine the color of each face.

5. The edge cubes connect two faces and have two colors.

6. The corner cubes connect three faces and have three colors.

This understanding will help us identify which edge cube (with two colors) is missing based on the clues provided in the problem.
Step1 :[?] List all possible edge cubes by color combinations (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've identified all possible edge cube combinations on a standard Rubik's cube. There are exactly 12 possible edge cube combinations, which matches the total number of edge cubes in a standard Rubik's cube.

The 12 possible edge cube combinations are:
1. white-blue
2. white-green
3. white-red
4. white-orange
5. yellow-blue
6. yellow-green
7. yellow-red
8. yellow-orange
9. blue-red
10. blue-orange
11. green-red
12. green-orange

Note that colors on opposite faces (white-yellow, blue-green, red-orange) cannot appear on the same edge cube because they are on opposite sides of the cube.

Each of these combinations represents one edge cube on the Rubik's cube. In the next step, I'll identify which of these edge cubes have been found based on the clues provided in the problem.
Step2 :[ ] Identify which edge cubes have been found based on the clues (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Determine which edge cube (two-colored) is missing (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Format the answer as a comma-separated list with colors in alphabetical order (depends on: 3)

Let's verify our understanding of the clues:

Standard Rubik's Cube Structure:
- 6 center cubes (1 colored face each)
- 12 edge cubes (2 colored faces each)
- 8 corner cubes (3 colored faces each)
- Total: 26 cubes

Opposite Faces:
- White <-> Yellow
- Blue <-> Green
- Red <-> Orange

All possible edge cubes: ['white-blue', 'white-green', 'white-red', 'white-orange', 'yellow-blue', 'yellow-green', 'yellow-red', 'yellow-orange', 'blue-red', 'blue-orange', 'green-red', 'green-orange']
Total number of edge cubes: 12

Clue 1: All blue cubes have been found
Blue edge cubes: ['white-blue', 'yellow-blue', 'blue-red', 'blue-orange']

Clue 2: All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found
Orange edge cubes: ['white-orange', 'yellow-orange', 'blue-orange', 'green-orange']

Clue 3: The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow
This means the yellow-green edge has been found

Clue 4: For all orange cubes found, the opposite face's cubes have been found
Orange is opposite to red, so all red edges are also found
Red edge cubes: ['white-red', 'yellow-red', 'blue-red', 'green-red']

Total found edge cubes: ['yellow-blue', 'blue-red', 'yellow-orange', 'blue-orange', 'yellow-red', 'green-orange', 'yellow-green', 'white-red', 'green-red', 'white-blue', 'white-orange']
Number of found edge cubes: 11

Missing edge cube(s): ['white-green']

The missing cube has colors: green,white

Double-checking Clue 3:
The clue states: 'The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow'
This means the yellow-green edge has been found, but doesn't necessarily mean all other green edges have been found
Green edges we've determined to be found: ['green-orange', 'green-red', 'yellow-green']
Green edges we haven't determined to be found: ['white-green']

Plan: Determine the Missing Two-Colored Cube from a Rubik's Cube
=================================================================

Progress: 3/5 steps completed (60.0%)
Status: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Understand the structure of a standard Rubik's cube
   Notes: I've analyzed the structure of a standard Rubik's cube:

1. A standard Rubik's cube is a 3x3x3 cube with 6 faces/sides, each with a different color: white, yellow, blue, green, red, and orange.

2. The cube consists of:
   - 6 center cubes (one on each face, each with 1 colored face)
   - 12 edge cubes (each with 2 colored faces)
   - 8 corner cubes (each with 3 colored faces)
   - Total visible cubelets: 26

3. The opposite faces on a standard Rubik's cube are:
   - White is opposite Yellow
   - Blue is opposite Green
   - Red is opposite Orange

4. The center cubes are fixed in relation to each other and determine the color of each face.

5. The edge cubes connect two faces and have two colors.

6. The corner cubes connect three faces and have three colors.

This understanding will help us identify which edge cube (with two colors) is missing based on the clues provided in the problem.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] List all possible edge cubes by color combinations (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've identified all possible edge cube combinations on a standard Rubik's cube. There are exactly 12 possible edge cube combinations, which matches the total number of edge cubes in a standard Rubik's cube.

The 12 possible edge cube combinations are:
1. white-blue
2. white-green
3. white-red
4. white-orange
5. yellow-blue
6. yellow-green
7. yellow-red
8. yellow-orange
9. blue-red
10. blue-orange
11. green-red
12. green-orange

Note that colors on opposite faces (white-yellow, blue-green, red-orange) cannot appear on the same edge cube because they are on opposite sides of the cube.

Each of these combinations represents one edge cube on the Rubik's cube. In the next step, I'll identify which of these edge cubes have been found based on the clues provided in the problem.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Identify which edge cubes have been found based on the clues (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've analyzed all the clues to identify which edge cubes have been found:

1. Clue: "All blue cubes have been found"
   - This means all 4 blue edge cubes have been found: white-blue, yellow-blue, blue-red, blue-orange

2. Clue: "All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found"
   - This means all 4 orange edge cubes have been found: white-orange, yellow-orange, blue-orange, green-orange

3. Clue: "The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow"
   - This means the yellow-green edge has been found

4. Clue: "For all orange cubes found, the opposite face's cubes have been found"
   - Orange is opposite to red, so all 4 red edge cubes have been found: white-red, yellow-red, blue-red, green-red

After accounting for duplicates, we've identified 11 of the 12 edge cubes as found:
- white-blue
- yellow-blue
- blue-red
- blue-orange
- white-orange
- yellow-orange
- green-orange
- yellow-green
- white-red
- yellow-red
- green-red

The only edge cube not accounted for is white-green, which must be the missing cube.
Details: 
Step3 :[ ] Determine which edge cube (two-colored) is missing (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Format the answer as a comma-separated list with colors in alphabetical order (depends on: 3)

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Understand the structure of a standard Rubik's cube
   Notes: I've analyzed the structure of a standard Rubik's cube:

1. A standard Rubik's cube is a 3x3x3 cube with 6 faces/sides, each with a different color: white, yellow, blue, green, red, and orange.

2. The cube consists of:
   - 6 center cubes (one on each face, each with 1 colored face)
   - 12 edge cubes (each with 2 colored faces)
   - 8 corner cubes (each with 3 colored faces)
   - Total visible cubelets: 26

3. The opposite faces on a standard Rubik's cube are:
   - White is opposite Yellow
   - Blue is opposite Green
   - Red is opposite Orange

4. The center cubes are fixed in relation to each other and determine the color of each face.

5. The edge cubes connect two faces and have two colors.

6. The corner cubes connect three faces and have three colors.

This understanding will help us identify which edge cube (with two colors) is missing based on the clues provided in the problem.
Step1 :[?] List all possible edge cubes by color combinations (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've identified all possible edge cube combinations on a standard Rubik's cube. There are exactly 12 possible edge cube combinations, which matches the total number of edge cubes in a standard Rubik's cube.

The 12 possible edge cube combinations are:
1. white-blue
2. white-green
3. white-red
4. white-orange
5. yellow-blue
6. yellow-green
7. yellow-red
8. yellow-orange
9. blue-red
10. blue-orange
11. green-red
12. green-orange

Note that colors on opposite faces (white-yellow, blue-green, red-orange) cannot appear on the same edge cube because they are on opposite sides of the cube.

Each of these combinations represents one edge cube on the Rubik's cube. In the next step, I'll identify which of these edge cubes have been found based on the clues provided in the problem.
Step2 :[?] Identify which edge cubes have been found based on the clues (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've analyzed all the clues to identify which edge cubes have been found:

1. Clue: "All blue cubes have been found"
   - This means all 4 blue edge cubes have been found: white-blue, yellow-blue, blue-red, blue-orange

2. Clue: "All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found"
   - This means all 4 orange edge cubes have been found: white-orange, yellow-orange, blue-orange, green-orange

3. Clue: "The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow"
   - This means the yellow-green edge has been found

4. Clue: "For all orange cubes found, the opposite face's cubes have been found"
   - Orange is opposite to red, so all 4 red edge cubes have been found: white-red, yellow-red, blue-red, green-red

After accounting for duplicates, we've identified 11 of the 12 edge cubes as found:
- white-blue
- yellow-blue
- blue-red
- blue-orange
- white-orange
- yellow-orange
- green-orange
- yellow-green
- white-red
- yellow-red
- green-red

The only edge cube not accounted for is white-green, which must be the missing cube.

4. The center cubes are fixed in relation to each other and determine the color of each face.

5. The edge cubes connect two faces and have two colors.

6. The corner cubes connect three faces and have three colors.

This understanding will help us identify which edge cube (with two colors) is missing based on the clues provided in the problem.
Step1 :[?] List all possible edge cubes by color combinations (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've identified all possible edge cube combinations on a standard Rubik's cube. There are exactly 12 possible edge cube combinations, which matches the total number of edge cubes in a standard Rubik's cube.

The 12 possible edge cube combinations are:
1. white-blue
2. white-green
3. white-red
4. white-orange
5. yellow-blue
6. yellow-green
7. yellow-red
8. yellow-orange
9. blue-red
10. blue-orange
11. green-red
12. green-orange

Note that colors on opposite faces (white-yellow, blue-green, red-orange) cannot appear on the same edge cube because they are on opposite sides of the cube.

Each of these combinations represents one edge cube on the Rubik's cube. In the next step, I'll identify which of these edge cubes have been found based on the clues provided in the problem.
Step2 :[?] Identify which edge cubes have been found based on the clues (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've analyzed all the clues to identify which edge cubes have been found:

1. Clue: "All blue cubes have been found"
   - This means all 4 blue edge cubes have been found: white-blue, yellow-blue, blue-red, blue-orange

2. Clue: "All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found"
   - This means all 4 orange edge cubes have been found: white-orange, yellow-orange, blue-orange, green-orange

3. Clue: "The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow"
   - This means the yellow-green edge has been found

4. Clue: "For all orange cubes found, the opposite face's cubes have been found"
   - Orange is opposite to red, so all 4 red edge cubes have been found: white-red, yellow-red, blue-red, green-red

After accounting for duplicates, we've identified 11 of the 12 edge cubes as found:
- white-blue
- yellow-blue
- blue-red
- blue-orange
- white-orange
- yellow-orange
- green-orange
- yellow-green
- white-red
- yellow-red
- green-red

The only edge cube not accounted for is white-green, which must be the missing cube.
Step3 :[ ] Determine which edge cube (two-colored) is missing (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Format the answer as a comma-separated list with colors in alphabetical order (depends on: 3)

Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Understand the structure of a standard Rubik's cube
   Notes: I've analyzed the structure of a standard Rubik's cube:

1. A standard Rubik's cube is a 3x3x3 cube with 6 faces/sides, each with a different color: white, yellow, blue, green, red, and orange.

2. The cube consists of:
   - 6 center cubes (one on each face, each with 1 colored face)
   - 12 edge cubes (each with 2 colored faces)
   - 8 corner cubes (each with 3 colored faces)
   - Total visible cubelets: 26

3. The opposite faces on a standard Rubik's cube are:
   - White is opposite Yellow
   - Blue is opposite Green
   - Red is opposite Orange

4. The center cubes are fixed in relation to each other and determine the color of each face.

5. The edge cubes connect two faces and have two colors.

6. The corner cubes connect three faces and have three colors.

This understanding will help us identify which edge cube (with two colors) is missing based on the clues provided in the problem.

5. yellow-blue
6. yellow-green
7. yellow-red
8. yellow-orange
9. blue-red
10. blue-orange
11. green-red
12. green-orange

Note that colors on opposite faces (white-yellow, blue-green, red-orange) cannot appear on the same edge cube because they are on opposite sides of the cube.

Each of these combinations represents one edge cube on the Rubik's cube. In the next step, I'll identify which of these edge cubes have been found based on the clues provided in the problem.
Step2 :[?] Identify which edge cubes have been found based on the clues (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've analyzed all the clues to identify which edge cubes have been found:

1. Clue: "All blue cubes have been found"
   - This means all 4 blue edge cubes have been found: white-blue, yellow-blue, blue-red, blue-orange

2. Clue: "All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found"
   - This means all 4 orange edge cubes have been found: white-orange, yellow-orange, blue-orange, green-orange

3. Clue: "The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow"
   - This means the yellow-green edge has been found

4. Clue: "For all orange cubes found, the opposite face's cubes have been found"
   - Orange is opposite to red, so all 4 red edge cubes have been found: white-red, yellow-red, blue-red, green-red

After accounting for duplicates, we've identified 11 of the 12 edge cubes as found:
- white-blue
- yellow-blue
- blue-red
- blue-orange
- white-orange
- yellow-orange
- green-orange
- yellow-green
- white-red
- yellow-red
- green-red

The only edge cube not accounted for is white-green, which must be the missing cube.
Step3 :[?] Determine which edge cube (two-colored) is missing (depends on: 2)
   Notes: After analyzing the 11 edge cubes that have been found (as identified in Step 2), I've determined that the missing edge cube must be the white-green edge cube.

The 11 edge cubes we've confirmed as found are:
1. white-blue
2. yellow-blue
3. blue-red
4. blue-orange
5. white-orange
6. yellow-orange
7. green-orange
8. yellow-green
9. white-red
10. yellow-red
11. green-red

Since a standard Rubik's cube has exactly 12 edge cubes, and we've accounted for 11 of them, the only possible missing edge cube is white-green.

This conclusion is consistent with all the clues provided:
- All blue cubes have been found
- All orange edge cubes have been found
- All red edge cubes have been found (as they're opposite to orange)
- The yellow-green edge has been found
- No specific mention was made about the white-green edge being found

Therefore, the missing cube has two colors: white and green.

Plan: Determine the Missing Two-Colored Cube from a Rubik's Cube
=================================================================

Progress: 5/5 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Understand the structure of a standard Rubik's cube
   Notes: I've analyzed the structure of a standard Rubik's cube:

1. A standard Rubik's cube is a 3x3x3 cube with 6 faces/sides, each with a different color: white, yellow, blue, green, red, and orange.

2. The cube consists of:
   - 6 center cubes (one on each face, each with 1 colored face)
   - 12 edge cubes (each with 2 colored faces)
   - 8 corner cubes (each with 3 colored faces)
   - Total visible cubelets: 26

3. The opposite faces on a standard Rubik's cube are:
   - White is opposite Yellow
   - Blue is opposite Green
   - Red is opposite Orange

4. The center cubes are fixed in relation to each other and determine the color of each face.

5. The edge cubes connect two faces and have two colors.

6. The corner cubes connect three faces and have three colors.

This understanding will help us identify which edge cube (with two colors) is missing based on the clues provided in the problem.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] List all possible edge cubes by color combinations (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've identified all possible edge cube combinations on a standard Rubik's cube. There are exactly 12 possible edge cube combinations, which matches the total number of edge cubes in a standard Rubik's cube.

The 12 possible edge cube combinations are:
1. white-blue
2. white-green
3. white-red
4. white-orange
5. yellow-blue
6. yellow-green
7. yellow-red
8. yellow-orange
9. blue-red
10. blue-orange
11. green-red
12. green-orange

Note that colors on opposite faces (white-yellow, blue-green, red-orange) cannot appear on the same edge cube because they are on opposite sides of the cube.

Each of these combinations represents one edge cube on the Rubik's cube. In the next step, I'll identify which of these edge cubes have been found based on the clues provided in the problem.

2. Clue: "All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found"
   - This means all 4 orange edge cubes have been found: white-orange, yellow-orange, blue-orange, green-orange

3. Clue: "The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow"
   - This means the yellow-green edge has been found

4. Clue: "For all orange cubes found, the opposite face's cubes have been found"
   - Orange is opposite to red, so all 4 red edge cubes have been found: white-red, yellow-red, blue-red, green-red

After accounting for duplicates, we've identified 11 of the 12 edge cubes as found:
- white-blue
- yellow-blue
- blue-red
- blue-orange
- white-orange
- yellow-orange
- green-orange
- yellow-green
- white-red
- yellow-red
- green-red
