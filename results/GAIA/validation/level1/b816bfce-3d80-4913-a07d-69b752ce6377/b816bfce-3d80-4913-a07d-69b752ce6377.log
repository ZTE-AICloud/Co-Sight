result of search_wiki: In Norse mythology, Hrei?marr (Old Norse: [?hr?i??mɑr?]; anglicized as Hreidmar) is a dwarf. He is featured in the V?lsunga saga and in Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda.
Hrei?marr was the father of Regin, Fafnir, ?tr, Lynghei?r and Lofnhei?r. He owned a house of glittering gold and flashing gems built by Regin and guarded by Fafnir. After Otr was accidentally killed by Loki, the ?sir repaid Hrei?marr with Andvari's gold and the ring Andvaranaut, a magical ring that could create gold.

result of search_wiki: In Germanic heroic legend and folklore, Fáfnir  is a worm or dragon slain by a member of the V?lsung family, typically Sigur?. In Nordic mythology, he is the son of Hrei?marr, and brother of Regin and ?tr and is attested throughout the V?lsung Cycle, where, Fáfnir slays his father out of greed, taking the ring and hoard of the dwarf Andvari and becoming a worm or dragon. Fáfnir's brother Regin later assisted Sigur? in obtaining the sword Gram, by which Fáfnir is killed. He has been identified with an unnamed dragon killed by a V?lsung in other Germanic works including Beowulf, the Nibelunglied and a number of skaldic poems. Fáfnir and his killing by Sigur? are further represented in numerous medieval carvings from the British Isles and Scandinavia, and a single axe head in a Scandinavian style found in Russia.

== Attestations ==


=== V?lsunga saga ===
When Loki mistakenly kills ?tr, Hrei?marr demands to be repaid with the amount of gold it takes to fill ?tr's skin and cover the outside. Loki takes this gold from the dwarf Andvari, who curses it and especially the ring Andvaranaut. Fáfnir kills his father for this gold, but eventually becomes a greedy worm or dragon.

   Notes: I have successfully identified Hreidmar and his sons from Norse mythology. Hreidmar was a dwarf in Norse mythology who owned a house of glittering gold guarded by his sons. His sons included Fafnir, Regin, Otr, Lynghei?r, and Lofnhei?r. Fafnir in particular is noted for guarding his father's house and later becoming a dragon after killing his father for gold.
