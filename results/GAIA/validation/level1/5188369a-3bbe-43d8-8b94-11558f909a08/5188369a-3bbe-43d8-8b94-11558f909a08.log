Did You Know?
Jingoism originated during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, when many British citizens were hostile toward Russia and felt Britain should intervene in the conflict. Supporters of the cause expressed their sentiments in a music-hall ditty with this refrain:
We don't want to fight, yet by jingo if we do,
We've got the ships, we've got the men,
We've got the money, too!
Someone holding the attitude implied in the song became known as a jingo or jingoist, and the attitude itself was dubbed jingoism. The jingo in the tune is probably a euphemism for Jesus.

Supporters of the cause expressed their sentiments in a music-hall ditty with this refrain:\nWe don\'t want to fight, yet by jingo if we do,\nWe\'ve got the ships, we\'ve got the men,\nWe\'ve got the money, too!\nSomeone holding the attitude implied in the song became known as a jingo or jingoist, and the attitude itself was dubbed jingoism. The jingo in the tune is probably a euphemism for Jesus.\nTest Your Vocabulary with M-W Quizzes\nName That Flower\nPlay Now\nHangman Lightning Round\nPlay Now\nName That Bird Quiz\nPlay Now\nGuess the Curious Origins of These Everyday Words\nPlay Now\nRhyme Disguise Quiz\nPlay Now\n12-Letter Words Quiz\nPlay Now\nQuiz\nUnscramble the letters to find a word that means "a supporter of a war or warlike policy": KWAH\nVIEW THE ANSWER\nPodcast\nMore Words of the Day\nApr 19\nfastidious\nApr 18\ncollaborate\nApr 17\nuncouth\nApr 16\nadversity\nApr 15\npugnacious\nApr 14\ndruthers\nSEE ALL WORDS OF THE DAY\nCan you solve 4 words at once?\nPlay\nPlay\nCan you solve 4 words at once? \nPlay\nPlay\nLove words?
