re-plan_result is I'll continue executing the plan to translate "I like apples" to Tizin. Let me work through the remaining steps based on the analysis already completed in Step 0.

For Step 1, I need to identify the correct grammatical components in Tizin based on the information provided.

In Tizin:
- Word order is Verb-Object-Subject
- The verb "Maktay" works as "is pleasing to" 
- This means "apples" would be the subject (the thing doing the pleasing)
- "I" would be the object (the one receiving the pleasing sensation)

For Step 2, I need to determine the correct verb form:
- We need the present tense of "Maktay"
- According to the instructions, present tense uses the root form "Maktay"

For Step 3, I need to identify the correct form of "apples":
- Since "apples" is the subject in Tizin (the thing doing the pleasing), I need the nominative form
- The nominative form of "apples" is "Apple"

For Step 4, I need to identify the correct form of "I":
- Since "I" is the object in Tizin (the one to whom apples are pleasing), I need the accusative form
- The accusative form of "I" is "Mato"

For Step 5, applying Tizin word order (Verb-Object-Subject):
- Verb: "Maktay" (present tense of "to like")
- Object: "Mato" (accusative form of "I")
- Subject: "Apple" (nominative form of "apples")

For Step 6, constructing the complete Tizin sentence:
- The sentence would be: "Maktay Mato Apple"

For Step 7, verifying the translation:
- Verb first: "Maktay" (present tense of "to like/is pleasing to")
- Direct object next: "Mato" (accusative form of "I")
- Subject last: "Apple" (nominative form of "apples")
- This follows the VSO order and uses the correct grammatical forms
- The meaning is equivalent to "Apples are pleasing to me" which is how "I like apples" is expressed in Tizin

Therefore, the translation of "I like apples" to Tizin is: "Maktay Mato Apple"

This can be read as "Is pleasing to me apples" or more naturally in English as "Apples are pleasing to me" which conveys the same meaning as "I like apples" but with the grammatical structure required by Tizin.

re-plan_result is I'll continue executing the plan to translate "I like apples" to Tizin, working through the remaining steps based on the completed steps.

For Step 2, I need to determine the correct verb form:
- We need the present tense of "Maktay"
- According to the instructions, the present tense uses the root form, which is "Maktay"

For Step 3, I need to identify the correct form of "apples":
- Since "apples" functions as the subject in Tizin (the thing doing the pleasing), I need the nominative form
- The nominative form of "apples" is "Apple"

For Step 4, I need to identify the correct form of "I":
- Since "I" functions as the object in Tizin (the one to whom apples are pleasing), I need the accusative form
- The accusative form of "I" is "Mato"

For Step 5, applying Tizin word order (Verb-Object-Subject):
- Verb: "Maktay" (present tense of "to like intensely")
- Object: "Mato" (accusative form of "I")
- Subject: "Apple" (nominative form of "apples")

For Step 6, constructing the complete Tizin sentence:
- The sentence would be: "Maktay Mato Apple"

For Step 7, verifying the translation:
- Verb first: "Maktay" (present tense of "to like intensely/is pleasing to")
- Direct object next: "Mato" (accusative form of "I")
- Subject last: "Apple" (nominative form of "apples")
- This follows the VSO order and uses the correct grammatical forms
- The meaning is equivalent to "Apples are pleasing to me" which is how "I like apples" is expressed in Tizin

Therefore, the translation of "I like apples" to Tizin is:

"Maktay Mato Apple"

This can be understood as "Is pleasing to me apples" or more naturally in English as "Apples are pleasing to me," which conveys the same meaning as "I like apples" but with the grammatical structure required by Tizin.

Plan: Translate "I like apples" to the Tizin language
======================================================

Progress: 3/8 steps completed (37.5%)
Status: 3 completed, 2 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the English sentence structure and meaning
   Notes: The English sentence "I like apples" has the following structure:
- Subject: "I" (the person doing the liking)
- Verb: "like" (present tense)
- Direct Object: "apples" (what is being liked)

However, in Tizin, there's an important difference in how the verb "Maktay" (to like intensely) works. According to the instructions, this verb is better translated as "is pleasing to" in English. This means that the semantic roles are reversed:
- What would be the object in English (apples) becomes the semantic subject in Tizin
- What would be the subject in English (I) becomes the semantic object in Tizin

So conceptually, we need to transform "I like apples" to something closer to "Apples are pleasing to me" for the Tizin translation.

Additionally, Tizin has a specific word order: Verb-Object-Subject, which is different from English's Subject-Verb-Object order.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify the correct grammatical components in Tizin (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Based on the analysis of Tizin grammar:

1. The verb will be "Maktay" (present tense form of "to like intensely")
2. The object will be "Mato" (accusative form of "I" - the recipient of the pleasing)
3. The subject will be "Apple" (nominative form of "apples" - the thing doing the pleasing)

This aligns with the explanation that in Tizin, the verb "Maktay" functions more like "is pleasing to" rather than the English concept of "like." Therefore, what would be the object in English (apples) becomes the subject in Tizin, and what would be the subject in English (I) becomes the object in Tizin.

The grammatical components are now correctly identified for constructing the Tizin sentence.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Determine the correct verb form to use (depends on: 1)
   Notes: According to the information provided, the verb "Maktay" is used in its root form for the present tense. Since we're translating "I like apples" (present tense), we'll use "Maktay" as our verb form in the Tizin sentence.

For Step 4 (corrected):
- Since "I" functions as the object in Tizin (the one to whom apples are pleasing), I need the accusative form
- According to the information provided, the accusative form of "I" is "Mato"

For Step 5, applying Tizin word order (Verb-Object-Subject):
- Verb: "Maktay" (present tense of "to like intensely")
- Object: "Mato" (accusative form of "I")
- Subject: "Apple" (nominative form of "apples")
- So the order is: Maktay Mato Apple

For Step 6, constructing the complete Tizin sentence:
- Based on the word order and forms identified, the complete sentence is: "Maktay Mato Apple"

For Step 7, verifying the translation:
- Verb first: "Maktay" (present tense of "to like intensely/is pleasing to")
- Direct object next: "Mato" (accusative form of "I")
- Subject last: "Apple" (nominative form of "apples")
- This follows the VSO order and uses the correct grammatical forms
- The meaning is equivalent to "Apples are pleasing to me" which is how "I like apples" is expressed in Tizin

Therefore, the translation of "I like apples" to Tizin is:

"Maktay Mato Apple"

This can be understood as "Is pleasing to me apples" or more naturally in English as "Apples are pleasing to me," which conveys the same meaning as "I like apples" but with the grammatical structure required by Tizin.

Plan: Translate "I like apples" to the Tizin language
======================================================

Progress: 6/8 steps completed (75.0%)
Status: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the English sentence structure and meaning
   Notes: The English sentence "I like apples" has the following structure:
- Subject: "I" (the person doing the liking)
- Verb: "like" (present tense)
- Direct Object: "apples" (what is being liked)

However, in Tizin, there's an important difference in how the verb "Maktay" (to like intensely) works. According to the instructions, this verb is better translated as "is pleasing to" in English. This means that the semantic roles are reversed:
- What would be the object in English (apples) becomes the semantic subject in Tizin
- What would be the subject in English (I) becomes the semantic object in Tizin

So conceptually, we need to transform "I like apples" to something closer to "Apples are pleasing to me" for the Tizin translation.

Additionally, Tizin has a specific word order: Verb-Object-Subject, which is different from English's Subject-Verb-Object order.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify the correct grammatical components in Tizin (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Based on the analysis of Tizin grammar:

1. The verb will be "Maktay" (present tense form of "to like intensely")
2. The object will be "Mato" (accusative form of "I" - the recipient of the pleasing)
3. The subject will be "Apple" (nominative form of "apples" - the thing doing the pleasing)

This aligns with the explanation that in Tizin, the verb "Maktay" functions more like "is pleasing to" rather than the English concept of "like." Therefore, what would be the object in English (apples) becomes the subject in Tizin, and what would be the subject in English (I) becomes the object in Tizin.

The grammatical components are now correctly identified for constructing the Tizin sentence.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Determine the correct verb form to use (depends on: 1)
   Notes: For the sentence "I like apples" in Tizin, we need to use the present tense form of the verb. According to the instructions, when the verb "Maktay" (to intensely like) is used in the present tense, it appears in its root form.

Therefore, the correct verb form to use is "Maktay".

This aligns with the explanation that in Tizin, this verb functions more like "is pleasing to" rather than the English concept of "like." So conceptually, we're expressing something closer to "Apples are pleasing to me" in Tizin.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the correct form of 'apples' to use (depends on: 1)
   Notes: After analyzing the role of "apples" in the Tizin sentence, I've determined that we need to use the nominative form "Apple". This is because in Tizin, with the verb "Maktay" (meaning "is pleasing to"), the thing that is liked (apples) functions as the grammatical subject of the sentence. According to the information provided, the nominative form of "apples" in Tizin is "Apple". This form is appropriate since "apples" will be in the subject position in the Tizin sentence structure (Verb-Object-Subject).

Plan: Translate "I like apples" to the Tizin language
======================================================

Progress: 7/8 steps completed (87.5%)
Status: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the English sentence structure and meaning
   Notes: The English sentence "I like apples" has the following structure:
- Subject: "I" (the person doing the liking)
- Verb: "like" (present tense)
- Direct Object: "apples" (what is being liked)

However, in Tizin, there's an important difference in how the verb "Maktay" (to like intensely) works. According to the instructions, this verb is better translated as "is pleasing to" in English. This means that the semantic roles are reversed:
- What would be the object in English (apples) becomes the semantic subject in Tizin
- What would be the subject in English (I) becomes the semantic object in Tizin

So conceptually, we need to transform "I like apples" to something closer to "Apples are pleasing to me" for the Tizin translation.

Additionally, Tizin has a specific word order: Verb-Object-Subject, which is different from English's Subject-Verb-Object order.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify the correct grammatical components in Tizin (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Based on the analysis of Tizin grammar:

1. The verb will be "Maktay" (present tense form of "to like intensely")
2. The object will be "Mato" (accusative form of "I" - the recipient of the pleasing)
3. The subject will be "Apple" (nominative form of "apples" - the thing doing the pleasing)

This aligns with the explanation that in Tizin, the verb "Maktay" functions more like "is pleasing to" rather than the English concept of "like." Therefore, what would be the object in English (apples) becomes the subject in Tizin, and what would be the subject in English (I) becomes the object in Tizin.

The grammatical components are now correctly identified for constructing the Tizin sentence.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Determine the correct verb form to use (depends on: 1)
   Notes: For the sentence "I like apples" in Tizin, we need to use the present tense form of the verb. According to the instructions, when the verb "Maktay" (to intensely like) is used in the present tense, it appears in its root form.

Therefore, the correct verb form to use is "Maktay".

This aligns with the explanation that in Tizin, this verb functions more like "is pleasing to" rather than the English concept of "like." So conceptually, we're expressing something closer to "Apples are pleasing to me" in Tizin.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the correct form of 'apples' to use (depends on: 1)
   Notes: After analyzing the role of "apples" in the Tizin sentence, I've determined that we need to use the nominative form "Apple". This is because in Tizin, with the verb "Maktay" (meaning "is pleasing to"), the thing that is liked (apples) functions as the grammatical subject of the sentence. According to the information provided, the nominative form of "apples" in Tizin is "Apple". This form is appropriate since "apples" will be in the subject position in the Tizin sentence structure (Verb-Object-Subject).
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Identify the correct form of 'I' to use (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Step 2: step_status is completed, step_notes is According to the information provided, the verb "Maktay" is used in its root form for the present tense. Since we're translating "I like apples" (present tense), we'll use "Maktay" as our verb form in the Tizin sentence. 
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Apply Tizin word order (Verb-Object-Subject) (depends on: 1, 2, 3, 4)
   Notes: Following the Tizin word order of Verb-Object-Subject, I've arranged the components as follows:

1. Verb: "Maktay" (present tense form of "to like intensely")
2. Object: "Mato" (accusative form of "I" - the recipient of the pleasing)
3. Subject: "Apple" (nominative form of "apples" - the thing doing the pleasing)

So the word order for our translation will be: Maktay Mato Apple

This follows the Tizin grammatical structure where the verb comes first, followed by the direct object, and then the subject of the sentence.
Details: 
Step6 :[?] Construct the complete Tizin sentence (depends on: 5)
   Notes: Based on the Tizin grammar rules and word forms provided, I've constructed the complete Tizin sentence for "I like apples":

Verb (present tense of "to like intensely"): Maktay
Object (accusative form of "I"): Mato
Subject (nominative form of "apples"): Apple
