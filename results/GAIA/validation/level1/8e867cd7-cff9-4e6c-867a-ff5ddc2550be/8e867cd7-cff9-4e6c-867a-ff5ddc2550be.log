result of search_wiki: Haydée Mercedes "La Negra" Sosa (Latin American Spanish: [me??se?es ?sosa]; 9 July 1935 – 4 October 2009) was an Argentine singer who was popular throughout Latin America and many countries outside the region. With her roots in Argentine folk music, Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of El nuevo cancionero. She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the "voice of the voiceless ones". She was often called "the conscience of Latin America".

With her roots in Argentine folk music, Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of El nuevo cancionero. She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the "voice of the voiceless ones". She was often called "the conscience of Latin America".

Plan: Research Mercedes Sosa's Studio Albums (2000-2009)
=========================================================

Progress: 4/5 steps completed (80.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Research Mercedes Sosa's background and career on Wikipedia
   Notes: I have checked Mercedes Sosa's discography on Wikipedia and found that 'Acústico En Vivo' (2002) is listed under the 'Live albums' section, not under 'Studio albums'. The album is published by Sony Music Argentina as indicated in the discography.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify and list all albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I have identified all albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 according to her English Wikipedia page. The albums released during this period are:

Studio albums:
1. Corazón Libre (2005)
2. Cantora 1 (2009)
3. Cantora 2 (2009)

Live albums:
1. Acústico En Vivo (2002)
2. Argentina Quiere Cantar (2003) - with Víctor Heredia & León Gieco

This information was verified by checking the complete discography section on Mercedes Sosa's English Wikipedia page.

1. Corazón Libre (2005) - Label: Edge
2. Cantora 1 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)
3. Cantora 2 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)

I confirmed that "Acústico En Vivo" (2002) and "Argentina Quiere Cantar" (2003) are classified as live albums, not studio albums, on Wikipedia. I also investigated "Misa Criolla" (2000) which appeared in one search result but confirmed it's not listed under studio albums in the Wikipedia discography section.

This verification was done by directly examining the Wikipedia page's discography section and cross-checking with multiple searches to ensure accuracy.
Details:

Plan: Research Mercedes Sosa's Studio Albums (2000-2009)
=========================================================

Progress: 5/5 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Research Mercedes Sosa's background and career on Wikipedia
   Notes: I have checked Mercedes Sosa's discography on Wikipedia and found that 'Acústico En Vivo' (2002) is listed under the 'Live albums' section, not under 'Studio albums'. The album is published by Sony Music Argentina as indicated in the discography.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify and list all albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I have identified all albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 according to her English Wikipedia page. The albums released during this period are:

Studio albums:
1. Corazón Libre (2005)
2. Cantora 1 (2009)
3. Cantora 2 (2009)

Live albums:
1. Acústico En Vivo (2002)
2. Argentina Quiere Cantar (2003) - with Víctor Heredia & León Gieco

This information was verified by checking the complete discography section on Mercedes Sosa's English Wikipedia page.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Verify the information is complete and accurate based on Wikipedia (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have verified the information about Mercedes Sosa's albums released between 2000 and 2009 using the latest English Wikipedia version. According to Wikipedia, Mercedes Sosa released exactly 3 studio albums during this period:

1. Corazón Libre (2005) - Label: Edge
2. Cantora 1 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)
3. Cantora 2 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)

I confirmed that "Acústico En Vivo" (2002) and "Argentina Quiere Cantar" (2003) are classified as live albums, not studio albums, on Wikipedia. I also investigated "Misa Criolla" (2000) which appeared in one search result but confirmed it's not listed under studio albums in the Wikipedia discography section.

This verification was done by directly examining the Wikipedia page's discography section and cross-checking with multiple searches to ensure accuracy.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Count the total number of studio albums released between 2000-2009 (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I have counted the total number of studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 (inclusive) based on the latest English Wikipedia information. According to the official Wikipedia discography section, Mercedes Sosa released exactly 3 studio albums during this period:

1. Corazón Libre (2005) - Label: Edge
2. Cantora 1 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)
3. Cantora 2 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)

I verified this information by directly checking the Wikipedia page and using browser tools to examine the discography section. While AllMusic lists additional albums during this period, the question specifically asks for information from the latest 2022 version of English Wikipedia, which clearly categorizes only these three as studio albums. The other albums mentioned in AllMusic are either categorized differently on Wikipedia (as live albums or compilations) or are not listed in the official Wikipedia discography.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Compile findings and provide the final answer with supporting evidence (depends on: 3)
   Notes: I have compiled all the findings from the research on Mercedes Sosa's discography between 2000 and 2009. According to the latest English Wikipedia information, Mercedes Sosa released exactly 3 studio albums during this period:

1. Corazón Libre (2005) - Label: Edge
2. Cantora 1 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)
3. Cantora 2 (2009) - Label: RCA (with various artists)

I verified that "Acústico En Vivo" (2002) and "Argentina Quiere Cantar" (2003) are classified as live albums, not studio albums, on Wikipedia. No other studio albums from this period are listed in her Wikipedia discography.

Therefore, the final answer to the question "How many studio albums were published by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009 (included)?" is: 3 studio albums.
