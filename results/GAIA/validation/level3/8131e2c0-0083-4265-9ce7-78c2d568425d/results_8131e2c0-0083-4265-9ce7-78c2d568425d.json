I know that the Cheater still outperformed the Cheater Beater in terms of CFM. Could you please look that up for me, and report the CFM of both the Cheater and the Cheater Beater? I'm not sure if he made any changes to his testing, but this was back in season 4, so just report the value from that season. Please format your response like this: CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater",
