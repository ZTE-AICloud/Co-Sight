result of search_wiki: Charles "Pete" Conrad Jr. (June 2, 1930 – July 8, 1999) was an American NASA astronaut, aeronautical engineer, naval officer, aviator, and test pilot who commanded the Apollo 12 mission, on which he became the third person to walk on the Moon. Conrad was selected for NASA's second astronaut class in 1962.
Conrad was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Despite having dyslexia, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University—being the first Ivy League astronaut—and joined the U.S. Navy.

result of search_wiki: NASA Astronaut Group 2 (nicknamed the "Next Nine" and the "New Nine") was the second group of astronauts selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Their selection was announced on September 17, 1962. The group augmented the Mercury Seven. President John F. Kennedy had announced Project Apollo, on May 25, 1961, with the ambitious goal of putting a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, and more astronauts were required to fly the two-man Gemini spacecraft and three-man Apollo spacecraft then under development. The Mercury Seven had been selected to accomplish the simpler task of orbital flight, but the new challenges of space rendezvous and lunar landing led to the selection of candidates with advanced engineering degrees (for four of the nine) as well as test pilot experience.

result of search_wiki: Charles "Pete" Conrad Jr. (June 2, 1930 – July 8, 1999) was an American NASA astronaut, aeronautical engineer, naval officer, aviator, and test pilot who commanded the Apollo 12 mission, on which he became the third person to walk on the Moon. Conrad was selected for NASA's second astronaut class in 1962.
Conrad was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Despite having dyslexia, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University—being the first Ivy League astronaut—and joined the U.S. Navy.

result of search_wiki: NASA Astronaut Group 2 (nicknamed the "Next Nine" and the "New Nine") was the second group of astronauts selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Their selection was announced on September 17, 1962. The group augmented the Mercury Seven. President John F. Kennedy had announced Project Apollo, on May 25, 1961, with the ambitious goal of putting a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, and more astronauts were required to fly the two-man Gemini spacecraft and three-man Apollo spacecraft then under development. The Mercury Seven had been selected to accomplish the simpler task of orbital flight, but the new challenges of space rendezvous and lunar landing led to the selection of candidates with advanced engineering degrees (for four of the nine) as well as test pilot experience.

result of search_wiki: NASA Astronaut Group 2 (nicknamed the "Next Nine" and the "New Nine") was the second group of astronauts selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Their selection was announced on September 17, 1962. The group augmented the Mercury Seven. President John F. Kennedy had announced Project Apollo, on May 25, 1961, with the ambitious goal of putting a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, and more astronauts were required to fly the two-man Gemini spacecraft and three-man Apollo spacecraft then under development. The Mercury Seven had been selected to accomplish the simpler task of orbital flight, but the new challenges of space rendezvous and lunar landing led to the selection of candidates with advanced engineering degrees (for four of the nine) as well as test pilot experience.

See, Jr. | Dallas, Texas,July 23, 1927 | St. Louis,Missouri,February 28, 1966 | See graduated from theUnited States Merchant Marine Academyin 1949 with a Bachelor of Science degree inmarine engineeringand a commission in theUnited States Naval Reserve. That year he joinedGeneral Electric. He served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from 1953 to 1956, then rejoined General Electric, becoming a test pilot. He earned a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of California in Los Angeles in 1962. See was chosen as the command pilot ofGemini 9, but died in aT-38 plane crashless than four months before launch. | [39][38]
 | Thomas P. Stafford | Weatherford, Oklahoma,September 17, 1930 | Satellite Beach, Florida,March 18, 2024 | Stafford graduated with a Bachelor of Science  degree from theUnited States Naval AcademyatAnnapolis, Marylandwith the Class of 1952 and joined the USAF.  He graduated from theUSAF Experimental Test Pilot Schoolwith Class 58-C. He made his first spaceflight in December 1965 as the pilot ofGemini 6A, which made the first space rendezvous, with Gemini 7. In June of the following year he commandedGemini 9A. In 1969, Stafford was the commander ofApollo 10, the second crewed mission to orbit the Moon and the first to fly a Lunar Module in lunar orbit, descending to an altitude of 9 miles (14 km) above its surface. On the return to Earth, the Apollo 10 spacecraft achieved a speed of 24,791 miles per hour (39,897 km/h), setting the record for the fastest speed achieved by human beings. In 1975, Stafford was the commander of theApollo-Soyuz Test Projectflight, the first joint U.S.-Soviet space mission. He was a brigadier general at the time of the mission, becoming the first general officer to fly in space, as well as the first member of his Naval Academy class to pin on the first, second, and third stars of a general officer. He retired from the USAF in 1979. | [39][49][50][51]
 | Edward H. White II | San Antonio, Texas,November 14, 1930 | Cape Canaveral, Florida,January 27, 1967 | White received a Bachelor of Science degree from theUnited States Military AcademyatWest Point, graduating with the Class of 1952. He joined the USAF and became afighter pilot. He earned a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan in 1959.  He graduated from theUSAF Experimental Test Pilot Schoolwith Class 59-C. In June 1965, he flew onGemini 4as its pilot, during which he conducted the first Americanspacewalk. He was selected as the Senior Pilot ofApollo 1, the inaugural flight of the Apollo spacecraft. White was killed in the fire on the launch pad test in January 1967, a month before the scheduled liftoff. | [39][52]
 | John W. Young | San Francisco, California,September 24, 1930 | Houston,Texas,January 5, 2018 | Young graduated fromGeorgia Institute of Technologywith a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1952 and joined the Navy. He set world time-to-climb records for 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) and 25,000 metres (82,000 ft). His first space mission was as pilot ofGemini 3, the first crewed Gemini mission,  in March 1965. He went on to commandGemini 10in July 1966. In May 1969, he was Command Module pilot ofApollo 10, the "dress rehearsal" for theApollo 11Moon landing. On the way back to Earth, the Apollo 10 crew reached a speed of 24,791 miles per hour (39,897 km/h), the highest speed attained by a crewed vehicle. He returned to the Moon in April 1972 as commander ofApollo 16, the fifth crewed lunar landing, becoming the ninth person to walk on the Moon and the second to fly to it twice. He served asChief of the Astronaut Officefrom 1974 to 1987. In April 1981, he commanded theSTS-1mission, the maiden flight of theSpace ShuttleColumbia. When he commandedSTS-9, the firstSpacelabmission, in November 1983, he became the first person to travel into space six times. | [39][49][53]

Steps:
Step0 :[✓] Find and analyze the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from January 21, 2006 to identify the two astronauts
   Notes: Successfully identified the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from January 21, 2006. The image shows Apollo 12 astronauts. The two astronauts visible are Alan Bean (the astronaut wearing the helmet) and Charles "Pete" Conrad (visible as a reflection in Bean's helmet, appearing smaller). The image is described as a self-portrait where Conrad photographed Bean, and Conrad himself appears as a reflection in Bean's helmet.
Details: 
Step1 :[✓] Identify which astronaut appears smaller in the image (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've successfully identified which astronaut appears smaller in the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from January 21, 2006. The image shows Apollo 12 astronauts Alan Bean and Charles "Pete" Conrad. Conrad is the astronaut who appears smaller in the image, as he is visible only as a reflection in Bean's helmet. This was a self-portrait where Conrad was the photographer, and he captured his own reflection in Bean's visor. Based on the information from the APOD website and Wikipedia, Charles "Pete" Conrad was part of NASA's second astronaut class (NASA Astronaut Group 2), selected in 1962, also known as the "Next Nine" or "New Nine."

result of search_wiki: Edward Higgins White II (November 14, 1930 – January 27, 1967) was an American aeronautical engineer, United States Air Force officer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut. He was a member of the crews of Gemini 4 and Apollo 1.
After graduating from West Point in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science degree, White was sent to flight training, and assigned to the 22nd Fighter Day Squadron at Bitburg Air Base, West Germany, where he flew the F-86 Sabre and F-100 Super Sabre fighters. In 1958, he enrolled in the University of Michigan to study aeronautical engineering, receiving his Master of Science degree in 1959. White then received test pilot training at Edwards Air Force Base, California, before being assigned as a test pilot for the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

result of search_wiki: Gemini 4 (officially Gemini IV) was the second crewed spaceflight in NASA's Project Gemini, occurring in June 1965. It was the tenth crewed American spaceflight (including two X-15 flights at altitudes exceeding 100 kilometers (62 mi; 54 nmi)). Astronauts James McDivitt and Ed White orbited the Earth 66 times in four days, making it the first US flight to approach the five-day flight of the Soviet Vostok 5. The highlight of the mission was the first space walk by an American, during which White floated free outside the spacecraft, tethered to it, for approximately 23 minutes.
The flight also included the first attempt to make a space rendezvous as McDivitt attempted to maneuver his craft close to the Titan II upper stage which launched it into orbit, but this was not successful.

Plan: Research NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day Astronaut Question
====================================================================

Progress: 5/5 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[✓] Find and analyze the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from January 21, 2006 to identify the two astronauts
   Notes: Successfully identified the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from January 21, 2006. The image shows Apollo 12 astronauts. The two astronauts visible are Alan Bean (the astronaut wearing the helmet) and Charles "Pete" Conrad (visible as a reflection in Bean's helmet, appearing smaller). The image is described as a self-portrait where Conrad photographed Bean, and Conrad himself appears as a reflection in Bean's helmet.
Details: 
Step1 :[✓] Identify which astronaut appears smaller in the image (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've successfully identified which astronaut appears smaller in the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from January 21, 2006. The image shows Apollo 12 astronauts Alan Bean and Charles "Pete" Conrad. Conrad is the astronaut who appears smaller in the image, as he is visible only as a reflection in Bean's helmet. This was a self-portrait where Conrad was the photographer, and he captured his own reflection in Bean's visor. Based on the information from the APOD website and Wikipedia, Charles "Pete" Conrad was part of NASA's second astronaut class (NASA Astronaut Group 2), selected in 1962, also known as the "Next Nine" or "New Nine."
Details: 
Step2 :[✓] Research which NASA Astronaut Group Charles 'Pete' Conrad belonged to (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've confirmed that Charles "Pete" Conrad was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 2, also known as the "Next Nine" or "New Nine." This group was selected in 1962 to augment the original Mercury Seven astronauts. NASA Astronaut Group 2 was formed to meet the challenges of the Gemini and Apollo programs, including space rendezvous and lunar landing missions. This information will be used to research all astronauts from this group in the next step.
Details: 
Step3 :[✓] Compile a list of all astronauts from NASA Astronaut Group 2 who spent time in space (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've successfully compiled a list of all astronauts from NASA Astronaut Group 2 who spent time in space. The group consisted of nine astronauts: Neil Armstrong, Frank Borman, Pete Conrad, James Lovell, James McDivitt, Elliot See, Thomas Stafford, Edward White, and John Young. 

Of these, Elliot See never flew in space as he died in a T-38 plane crash before his scheduled Gemini 9 mission. The remaining eight astronauts all spent time in space, with their durations as follows:

1. Neil Armstrong: 8d 14h 12m
2. Frank Borman: 19d 21h 35m
3. Pete Conrad: 49d 3h 38m
4. James Lovell: 29d 19h 5m
5. James McDivitt: 14d 2h 56m
6. Thomas Stafford: 21d 3h 42m
7. Edward White: 4d 1h 56m
8. John Young: 34d 19h 39m

This information will be used in the next step to calculate the space time duration in minutes for each astronaut and identify who spent the least time in space.
Details: 
Step4 :[✓] Calculate the space time duration in minutes for each astronaut in NASA Astronaut Group 2 and identify who spent the least time (depends on: 3)
   Notes: I've successfully calculated the space time duration in minutes for each astronaut in NASA Astronaut Group 2 and identified who spent the least time in space. After converting the time durations from days, hours, and minutes to total minutes, I found that Edward White spent the least amount of time in space among the astronauts who actually went to space.

Edward White's total time in space was 4 days, 1 hour, and 56 minutes, which converts to 5,876 minutes. This was verified through multiple sources, including NASA's website information about the Gemini IV mission.

White only flew on one space mission (Gemini IV) before his tragic death in the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967. The other astronauts in NASA Astronaut Group 2 who went to space all accumulated more time in orbit across their various missions.
