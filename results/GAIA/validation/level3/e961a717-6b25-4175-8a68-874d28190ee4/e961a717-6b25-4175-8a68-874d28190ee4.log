result of search_wiki: A landlocked country is a country that has no territory connected to an ocean or whose coastlines lie solely on endorheic basins. Currently, there are 44 landlocked countries, two of them doubly landlocked (Liechtenstein and Uzbekistan), and three landlocked de facto states in the world. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, Kyrgyzstan is the furthest landlocked country from any ocean, while Ethiopia is the world's most populous landlocked country.
Generally, being landlocked creates political and economic disadvantages that having access to international waters would avoid. For this reason, nations large and small throughout history have fought to gain access to open waters, even at great expense in wealth, bloodshed, and political capital.

======================================================================

Progress: 2/3 steps completed (66.7%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[✓] Search Wikipedia for a list of Asian countries with monarchies as of 2021
   Notes: I searched Wikipedia for information about Asian countries with monarchies. According to Wikipedia, there are 13 monarchies in Asia as of 2021:
1. Bahrain
2. Bhutan
3. Brunei
4. Cambodia
5. Japan
6. Jordan
7. Kuwait
8. Malaysia
9. Oman
10. Qatar
11. Saudi Arabia
12. Thailand
13. United Arab Emirates

I found this information from the "List of current monarchies" and "Monarchies in Asia" Wikipedia pages. This step is now complete and I can proceed to verify which of these monarchies have access to the sea.
Step1 :[✓] Research which of these monarchical countries have coastlines/access to the sea (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I researched which of the 13 Asian monarchies have access to the sea. Based on Wikipedia information:

Countries WITH sea access:
1. Bahrain - Island country in the Persian Gulf
2. Brunei - Coastline on the South China Sea
3. Cambodia - Coastline along the Gulf of Thailand
4. Japan - Island nation surrounded by the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and East China Sea
5. Jordan - Small coastline along the Red Sea
6. Kuwait - Coastline on the Persian Gulf (implied by its location)
7. Malaysia - Maritime borders with multiple countries, coastlines on the South China Sea
8. Oman - Coastline on the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman
9. Qatar - Peninsula with coastline on the Persian Gulf
10. Saudi Arabia - Coastlines on the Red Sea and Persian Gulf
11. Thailand - Coastlines on the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand
12. United Arab Emirates - Coastline on the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman

Countries WITHOUT sea access:
1. Bhutan - Landlocked country in South Asia

This research confirms that 12 out of the 13 Asian monarchies have access to the sea, with only Bhutan being landlocked.
