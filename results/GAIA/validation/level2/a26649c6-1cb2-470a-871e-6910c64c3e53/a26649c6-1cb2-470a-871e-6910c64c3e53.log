Plan: Determine the Absolute Difference in Chinstrap Penguin Population Estimates
==================================================================================

Progress: 1/8 steps completed (12.5%)
Status: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 7 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Search for and access the Wikipedia page on penguin species populations
   Notes: Successfully found and accessed the Wikipedia page on penguin species populations. The page is "List of Sphenisciformes by population" at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sphenisciformes_by_population which contains information about chinstrap penguin population.
Details: 
Step1 :[ ] Locate and record the chinstrap penguin population estimate from the end of 2018 (depends on: 0)
Step2 :[ ] Search for and access the Nature.com article 'global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin' from 2020 (depends on: 0)
Step3 :[ ] Extract the chinstrap penguin population data from the Nature.com article (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Convert the Nature.com data to total population if it's given in breeding pairs (multiply by 2 if needed) (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Calculate the absolute difference between the two population figures (depends on: 1, 4)
Step6 :[ ] Convert the absolute difference to tens of thousands (divide by 10,000) (depends on: 5)
Step7 :[ ] Formulate the final answer with proper units and context (depends on: 6)

re-plan_result is I'll continue with the current plan as it's well-structured and appropriate for the task. Let's proceed with the next steps based on the progress so far.

The plan is still viable and doesn't need structural adjustments. Step 0 has been completed successfully, which means we can now proceed with steps 1 and 2 in parallel since they both depend only on step 0.

Plan does not need adjustment, continue execution

The next actions should be:
1. Locate and record the chinstrap penguin population estimate from the end of 2018 on the Wikipedia page that was found
2. Search for and access the Nature.com article "global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin" from 2020

These steps can be executed simultaneously as they don't depend on each other. Once both are completed, we can continue with the subsequent steps in the plan to calculate the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the two population figures.

result of search_wiki: This is a list of Sphenisciformes species by global population. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields.
Sphenisciformes (from the Latin for "wedge-shaped") is the taxonomic order to which the penguins belong. BirdLife International has assessed 18 species. 16 (89% of total species) have had their population estimated: those missing are the king and little penguins, both of which have been assessed as being of least concern.

According to this study, the total global population estimate for Chinstrap penguins is 3.42 million breeding pairs (with a 95th-percentile confidence interval of [2.98, 4.00] million breeding pairs) across 375 extant colonies.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Convert the Nature.com data to total population if it's given in breeding pairs (multiply by 2 if needed) (depends on: 3)
   Notes: According to the Nature.com article, the chinstrap penguin population is estimated at 3.42 million breeding pairs. As specified in the question, we need to assume two penguins per breeding pair to get the total population. Therefore:

Total population = Number of breeding pairs × 2
Total population = 3.42 million × 2
Total population = 6.84 million penguins

So the total chinstrap penguin population according to the Nature.com article from 2020 is 6.84 million individuals.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Calculate the absolute difference between the two population figures (depends on: 1, 4)
   Notes: Successfully calculated the absolute difference between the two chinstrap penguin population figures:

1. Wikipedia population (end of 2018): 8,000,000 mature individuals
2. Nature.com population (2020): 6,840,000 individuals (calculated from 3.42 million breeding pairs × 2)

The absolute difference between these two population estimates is 1,160,000 individuals.

This calculation was performed by taking the absolute value of the difference between the two population figures:
|8,000,000 - 6,840,000| = 1,160,000
Details: 
Step6 :[?] Convert the absolute difference to tens of thousands (divide by 10,000) (depends on: 5)
   Notes: Successfully converted the absolute difference to tens of thousands by dividing the absolute difference (1,160,000) by 10,000:

1,160,000 ÷ 10,000 = 116.0

Therefore, the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the two population estimates is 116.0.

1. From Wikipedia (end of 2018): 8,000,000 mature individuals
2. From Nature.com (2020): 3.42 million breeding pairs

Since the question specifies "assuming two penguins per breeding pair," I needed to convert the Nature.com figure:
3.42 million breeding pairs × 2 = 6.84 million individuals = 6,840,000 individuals

The absolute difference between these populations is:
