result of search_wiki: Paula Dorothy Cole (born April 5, 1968) is an American singer and songwriter. After gaining attention for her performances as a vocalist on Peter Gabriel's 1993–1994 Secret World Tour, she released her first album, Harbinger, which suffered from a lack of promotion when the label, Imago Records, folded shortly after its release. Her second album, This Fire (1996), brought her worldwide acclaim, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard 200 album chart and producing two hit singles, the triple-Grammy nominated "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?", which reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1997, and "I Don't Want to Wait", which was used as the theme song of the television show Dawson's Creek. Cole was a featured performer in the 1996 prototype mini-tour for Lilith Fair, and also was a headliner for Lilith Fair in 1997 and 1998. She won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1998, and also became the first woman ever to be nominated for "Producer of the Year" in her own right in that same year.

result of search_wiki: Paula Dorothy Cole (born April 5, 1968) is an American singer and songwriter. After gaining attention for her performances as a vocalist on Peter Gabriel's 1993–1994 Secret World Tour, she released her first album, Harbinger, which suffered from a lack of promotion when the label, Imago Records, folded shortly after its release. Her second album, This Fire (1996), brought her worldwide acclaim, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard 200 album chart and producing two hit singles, the triple-Grammy nominated "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?", which reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1997, and "I Don't Want to Wait", which was used as the theme song of the television show Dawson's Creek. Cole was a featured performer in the 1996 prototype mini-tour for Lilith Fair, and also was a headliner for Lilith Fair in 1997 and 1998. She won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1998, and also became the first woman ever to be nominated for "Producer of the Year" in her own right in that same year.

========================================================================================

Progress: 3/7 steps completed (42.9%)
Status: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 4 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999
   Notes: I have identified all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999. Based on my research, Fiona Apple released only one album before 1999: "Tidal" (released on July 23, 1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released on November 9, 1999, which falls within 1999 rather than before it, so it doesn't count for our purposes. This information is confirmed from multiple sources including Wikipedia and other music references.
Step1 :[?] Identify all albums released by Paula Cole before 1999
   Notes: Successfully identified Paula Cole's albums released before 1999:
1. "Harbinger" (1994)
2. "This Fire" (1996)

Also gathered information about Fiona Apple's pre-1999 album:
1. "Tidal" (1996)

Additionally found that Robert Christgau gave Fiona Apple's "Tidal" a rating of "Neither," which is not a letter grade in his rating system. This information will be useful for the upcoming steps where we need to determine which albums didn't receive letter grades from Christgau.
Step2 :[?] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've researched Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums and identified that she released one album before 1999: Tidal (1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released in November 1999, which technically doesn't qualify as "before 1999" for our task. 

I've also identified Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums: Harbinger (1994) and This Fire (1996).

In the next step, I'll need to research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for these albums to determine which ones didn't receive a letter grade from him.
Step3 :[ ] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 1)
Step4 :[ ] Compile a list of albums from both artists that didn't receive a letter grade from Christgau (depends on: 2, 3)
Step5 :[ ] Sort the list alphabetically and format as a comma-delimited list (depends on: 4)

Plan: Research Fiona Apple and Paula Cole Albums Without Robert Christgau Letter Grades
========================================================================================

Progress: 4/7 steps completed (57.1%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999
   Notes: I have identified all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999. Based on my research, Fiona Apple released only one album before 1999: "Tidal" (released on July 23, 1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released on November 9, 1999, which falls within 1999 rather than before it, so it doesn't count for our purposes. This information is confirmed from multiple sources including Wikipedia and other music references.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify all albums released by Paula Cole before 1999
   Notes: Successfully identified Paula Cole's albums released before 1999:
1. "Harbinger" (1994)
2. "This Fire" (1996)

Also gathered information about Fiona Apple's pre-1999 album:
1. "Tidal" (1996)

Additionally found that Robert Christgau gave Fiona Apple's "Tidal" a rating of "Neither," which is not a letter grade in his rating system. This information will be useful for the upcoming steps where we need to determine which albums didn't receive letter grades from Christgau.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've researched Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums and identified that she released one album before 1999: Tidal (1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released in November 1999, which technically doesn't qualify as "before 1999" for our task. 

I've also identified Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums: Harbinger (1994) and This Fire (1996).

In the next step, I'll need to research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for these albums to determine which ones didn't receive a letter grade from him.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've researched Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums. Based on my search on Robert Christgau's official website:

1. "This Fire" (1996) - Received a letter grade of C+ from Robert Christgau
2. "Harbinger" (1994) - No review or letter grade found on Christgau's website

I also confirmed that Fiona Apple's "Tidal" (1996) received a "Neither" rating, which is not a letter grade in Christgau's rating system.

This completes our research on both artists' pre-1999 albums and their Christgau ratings.
Details: 
Step4 :[ ] Compile a list of albums from both artists that didn't receive a letter grade from Christgau (depends on: 2, 3)
Step5 :[ ] Sort the list alphabetically and format as a comma-delimited list (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Verify the accuracy of the final answer (depends on: 5)

Plan: Research Fiona Apple and Paula Cole Albums Without Robert Christgau Letter Grades
========================================================================================

Progress: 5/7 steps completed (71.4%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999
   Notes: I have identified all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999. Based on my research, Fiona Apple released only one album before 1999: "Tidal" (released on July 23, 1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released on November 9, 1999, which falls within 1999 rather than before it, so it doesn't count for our purposes. This information is confirmed from multiple sources including Wikipedia and other music references.

Step1 :[?] Identify all albums released by Paula Cole before 1999
   Notes: Successfully identified Paula Cole's albums released before 1999:
1. "Harbinger" (1994)
2. "This Fire" (1996)

Also gathered information about Fiona Apple's pre-1999 album:
1. "Tidal" (1996)

Additionally found that Robert Christgau gave Fiona Apple's "Tidal" a rating of "Neither," which is not a letter grade in his rating system. This information will be useful for the upcoming steps where we need to determine which albums didn't receive letter grades from Christgau.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've researched Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums and identified that she released one album before 1999: Tidal (1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released in November 1999, which technically doesn't qualify as "before 1999" for our task. 

I've also identified Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums: Harbinger (1994) and This Fire (1996).

In the next step, I'll need to research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for these albums to determine which ones didn't receive a letter grade from him.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've researched Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums. Based on my search on Robert Christgau's official website:

1. "This Fire" (1996) - Received a letter grade of C+ from Robert Christgau
2. "Harbinger" (1994) - No review or letter grade found on Christgau's website

I also confirmed that Fiona Apple's "Tidal" (1996) received a "Neither" rating, which is not a letter grade in Christgau's rating system.

This completes our research on both artists' pre-1999 albums and their Christgau ratings.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Compile a list of albums from both artists that didn't receive a letter grade from Christgau (depends on: 2, 3)
   Notes: I've compiled the list of albums from both artists that didn't receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau:

1. Fiona Apple's "Tidal" (1996) - Received a "Neither" rating, which is not a letter grade in Christgau's system
2. Paula Cole's "Harbinger" (1994) - No review or letter grade found on Christgau's website

These two albums will form our final list that needs to be sorted alphabetically and formatted as a comma-delimited list in the next step.
Details: 
Step5 :[ ] Sort the list alphabetically and format as a comma-delimited list (depends on: 4)

Progress: 6/7 steps completed (85.7%)
Status: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999
   Notes: I have identified all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999. Based on my research, Fiona Apple released only one album before 1999: "Tidal" (released on July 23, 1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released on November 9, 1999, which falls within 1999 rather than before it, so it doesn't count for our purposes. This information is confirmed from multiple sources including Wikipedia and other music references.

Plan: Research Fiona Apple and Paula Cole Albums Without Robert Christgau Letter Grades
========================================================================================

Progress: 7/7 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999
   Notes: I have identified all albums released by Fiona Apple before 1999. Based on my research, Fiona Apple released only one album before 1999: "Tidal" (released on July 23, 1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released on November 9, 1999, which falls within 1999 rather than before it, so it doesn't count for our purposes. This information is confirmed from multiple sources including Wikipedia and other music references.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify all albums released by Paula Cole before 1999
   Notes: Successfully identified Paula Cole's albums released before 1999:
1. "Harbinger" (1994)
2. "This Fire" (1996)

Also gathered information about Fiona Apple's pre-1999 album:
1. "Tidal" (1996)

Additionally found that Robert Christgau gave Fiona Apple's "Tidal" a rating of "Neither," which is not a letter grade in his rating system. This information will be useful for the upcoming steps where we need to determine which albums didn't receive letter grades from Christgau.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've researched Fiona Apple's pre-1999 albums and identified that she released one album before 1999: Tidal (1996). Her second album "When the Pawn..." was released in November 1999, which technically doesn't qualify as "before 1999" for our task. 

I've also identified Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums: Harbinger (1994) and This Fire (1996).

In the next step, I'll need to research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for these albums to determine which ones didn't receive a letter grade from him.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Research Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've researched Robert Christgau's reviews and ratings for Paula Cole's pre-1999 albums. Based on my search on Robert Christgau's official website:

1. "This Fire" (1996) - Received a letter grade of C+ from Robert Christgau
2. "Harbinger" (1994) - No review or letter grade found on Christgau's website

I also confirmed that Fiona Apple's "Tidal" (1996) received a "Neither" rating, which is not a letter grade in Christgau's rating system.

This completes our research on both artists' pre-1999 albums and their Christgau ratings.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Compile a list of albums from both artists that didn't receive a letter grade from Christgau (depends on: 2, 3)
   Notes: I've compiled the list of albums from both artists that didn't receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau:

1. Fiona Apple's "Tidal" (1996) - Received a "Neither" rating, which is not a letter grade in Christgau's system
2. Paula Cole's "Harbinger" (1994) - No review or letter grade found on Christgau's website

These two albums will form our final list that needs to be sorted alphabetically and formatted as a comma-delimited list in the next step.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Sort the list alphabetically and format as a comma-delimited list (depends on: 4)
   Notes: I've sorted the list of albums that didn't receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau alphabetically:

1. "Harbinger" (1994) by Paula Cole
2. "Tidal" (1996) by Fiona Apple

The comma-delimited list sorted alphabetically is: "Harbinger, Tidal"

This completes the sorting and formatting of our answer.
Details: 
Step6 :[?] Verify the accuracy of the final answer (depends on: 5)
   Notes: I've verified the accuracy of our final answer by double-checking all the information:

1. Confirmed Fiona Apple released only one album before 1999: "Tidal" (1996)
2. Confirmed Paula Cole released two albums before 1999: "Harbinger" (1994) and "This Fire" (1996)
3. Verified that Robert Christgau gave Paula Cole's "This Fire" a letter grade of C+
4. Confirmed that Robert Christgau gave Fiona Apple's "Tidal" a "Neither" rating, which is not a letter grade in his system
5. Verified that Robert Christgau did not review Paula Cole's "Harbinger" at all

Therefore, the albums that didn't receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau are:
- "Harbinger" (1994) by Paula Cole
- "Tidal" (1996) by Fiona Apple

The final answer, sorted alphabetically and formatted as a comma-delimited list, is: "Harbinger, Tidal"

Based on my research, I identified the albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole before 1999:

Fiona Apple:
- "Tidal" (1996) - Received a "Neither" rating from Robert Christgau, which is not a letter grade

Paula Cole:
- "Harbinger" (1994) - No review or letter grade found from Robert Christgau
- "This Fire" (1996) - Received a C+ letter grade from Robert Christgau

Therefore, the albums that didn't receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau are "Harbinger" and "Tidal". When sorted alphabetically, the correct order is "Harbinger, Tidal".

The question asks for a comma-delimited list of album titles, sorted alphabetically, so I need to provide just the album names separated by a comma in alphabetical order.
