Progress: 0/8 steps completed (0.0%)
Status: 0 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 8 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[ ] Install required Python libraries (Biopython)
Step1 :[ ] Download the PDB file for protein 5wb7 from RCSB Protein Data Bank (depends on: 0)
Step2 :[ ] Parse the PDB file using Biopython (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Identify the first and second atoms in the file (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Extract the 3D coordinates of these two atoms (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Calculate the Euclidean distance between the atoms in Angstroms (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Round the result to the nearest picometer (3 decimal places for Angstroms) (depends on: 5)
Step7 :[ ] Format and return the final answer as a number without units (depends on: 6)

Plan: Calculate distance between first and second atoms in PDB file 5wb7
=========================================================================

Progress: 2/5 steps completed (40.0%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Install required Python libraries (Biopython)
   Notes: Although I couldn't install Biopython due to proxy issues, I was able to download the PDB file directly and identify the first two atoms in the file. This approach will allow us to proceed with the calculation without requiring Biopython. The first atom (ATOM 1) is a nitrogen atom with coordinates (90.574, -8.433, 100.549), and the second atom (ATOM 2) is a carbon alpha atom with coordinates (91.872, -7.990, 100.059).
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Extract the 3D coordinates of the first two atoms from the PDB file (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted the 3D coordinates of the first two atoms from the PDB file:
- First atom (N, Serial: 1): coordinates (90.574, -8.433, 100.549)
- Second atom (CA, Serial: 2): coordinates (91.872, -7.99, 100.059)

These coordinates will be used in the next step to calculate the distance between the atoms.
Details: 
Step2 :[ ] Calculate the Euclidean distance between the atoms in Angstroms (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Round the result to the nearest picometer (3 decimal places for Angstroms) (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Format and return the final answer as a number without units (depends on: 3)

Plan: Calculate distance between first and second atoms in PDB file 5wb7
=========================================================================

Progress: 4/5 steps completed (80.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Install required Python libraries (Biopython)
   Notes: Although I couldn't install Biopython due to proxy issues, I was able to download the PDB file directly and identify the first two atoms in the file. This approach will allow us to proceed with the calculation without requiring Biopython. The first atom (ATOM 1) is a nitrogen atom with coordinates (90.574, -8.433, 100.549), and the second atom (ATOM 2) is a carbon alpha atom with coordinates (91.872, -7.990, 100.059).
Step1 :[?] Extract the 3D coordinates of the first two atoms from the PDB file (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully extracted the 3D coordinates of the first two atoms from the PDB file:
- First atom (N, Serial: 1): coordinates (90.574, -8.433, 100.549)
- Second atom (CA, Serial: 2): coordinates (91.872, -7.99, 100.059)

These coordinates will be used in the next step to calculate the distance between the atoms.
Step2 :[?] Calculate the Euclidean distance between the atoms in Angstroms (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully calculated the Euclidean distance between the first two atoms using their 3D coordinates. The distance is 1.4564178658613103 Angstroms. This calculation was done using the standard Euclidean distance formula: sqrt((x2-x1)? + (y2-y1)? + (z2-z1)?). The calculation is now ready for rounding to the nearest picometer in the next step.
Step3 :[?] Round the result to the nearest picometer (3 decimal places for Angstroms) (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Successfully rounded the distance between the first two atoms to the nearest picometer. The distance of 1.4564178658613103 Angstroms was rounded to 1.456 Angstroms, which represents rounding to the nearest picometer (since 1 Angstrom = 100 picometers, 3 decimal places in Angstroms corresponds to the nearest picometer). This rounded value will be used as the final answer.
Step4 :[ ] Format and return the final answer as a number without units (depends on: 3)
