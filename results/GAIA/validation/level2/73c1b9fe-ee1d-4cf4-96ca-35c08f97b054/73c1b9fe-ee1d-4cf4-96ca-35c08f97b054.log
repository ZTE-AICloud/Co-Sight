=======================================================================================

Progress: 1/11 steps completed (9.1%)
Status: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 10 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the natural geographic range of American Alligators to understand their historical distribution
   Notes: I've identified the natural geographic range of American Alligators according to USGS data. The indigenous range extends from coastal North Carolina south to Florida and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma. This does not include any states west of Texas.

Additionally, I found that according to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database, the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) was in California in 1954. This was an alligator collected from the Colorado River that had been released from a traveling carnival. This occurrence is classified as "collected (not established)" meaning it was an isolated incident rather than evidence of a natural population.

Other western states with documented alligator occurrences include Colorado (1978), Arizona (1990), and Idaho (2009), all of which were also isolated incidents of released or escaped captive animals rather than established populations.

This information will help inform the next steps of researching which states/regions west of Texas might have alligator populations or sightings.

Plan: Research When American Alligator Was First Found West of Texas According to USGS
=======================================================================================

Progress: 1/4 steps completed (25.0%)
Status: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the natural geographic range of American Alligators to understand their historical distribution
   Notes: I've identified the natural geographic range of American Alligators according to USGS data. The indigenous range extends from coastal North Carolina south to Florida and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma. This does not include any states west of Texas.

Additionally, I found that according to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database, the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) was in California in 1954. This was an alligator collected from the Colorado River that had been released from a traveling carnival. This occurrence is classified as "collected (not established)" meaning it was an isolated incident rather than evidence of a natural population.

Other western states with documented alligator occurrences include Colorado (1978), Arizona (1990), and Idaho (2009), all of which were also isolated incidents of released or escaped captive animals rather than established populations.

This information will help inform the next steps of researching which states/regions west of Texas might have alligator populations or sightings.
Step1 :[ ] Verify the 1954 California finding in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (depends on: 0)
Step2 :[ ] Check for any earlier occurrences in USGS records that might predate the 1954 California finding (depends on: 0)
Step3 :[ ] Formulate a clear answer citing the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (depends on: 0, 1, 2)

Plan: Research When American Alligator Was First Found West of Texas According to USGS
=======================================================================================

Progress: 2/4 steps completed (50.0%)
Status: 2 completed, 1 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the natural geographic range of American Alligators to understand their historical distribution
   Notes: I've identified the natural geographic range of American Alligators according to USGS data. The indigenous range extends from coastal North Carolina south to Florida and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma. This does not include any states west of Texas.

Additionally, I found that according to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database, the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) was in California in 1954. This was an alligator collected from the Colorado River that had been released from a traveling carnival. This occurrence is classified as "collected (not established)" meaning it was an isolated incident rather than evidence of a natural population.

Other western states with documented alligator occurrences include Colorado (1978), Arizona (1990), and Idaho (2009), all of which were also isolated incidents of released or escaped captive animals rather than established populations.

This information will help inform the next steps of researching which states/regions west of Texas might have alligator populations or sightings.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Verify the 1954 California finding in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I have verified the 1954 California finding in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database. According to the database, an American alligator was found in the Colorado River in California in 1954. The database specifically notes that this alligator "had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival" as cited by Bury and Luckenbach, 1978. This record is categorized as "failed" in status, meaning the species did not establish a population in this location. The occurrence is classified as a "native transplant" with the potential pathway being a "released pet." This confirms the information mentioned in Step 0 about the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas being in California in 1954.
Details: 
Step2 :[→] Check for any earlier occurrences in USGS records that might predate the 1954 California finding (depends on: 0)
Step3 :[ ] Formulate a clear answer citing the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (depends on: 0, 1, 2)

Plan: Research When American Alligator Was First Found West of Texas According to USGS
=======================================================================================

Progress: 3/4 steps completed (75.0%)
Status: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the natural geographic range of American Alligators to understand their historical distribution
   Notes: I've identified the natural geographic range of American Alligators according to USGS data. The indigenous range extends from coastal North Carolina south to Florida and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma. This does not include any states west of Texas.

Additionally, I found that according to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database, the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) was in California in 1954. This was an alligator collected from the Colorado River that had been released from a traveling carnival. This occurrence is classified as "collected (not established)" meaning it was an isolated incident rather than evidence of a natural population.

Other western states with documented alligator occurrences include Colorado (1978), Arizona (1990), and Idaho (2009), all of which were also isolated incidents of released or escaped captive animals rather than established populations.

This information will help inform the next steps of researching which states/regions west of Texas might have alligator populations or sightings.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Verify the 1954 California finding in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I have verified the 1954 California finding in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database. According to the database, an American alligator was found in the Colorado River in California in 1954. The database specifically notes that this alligator "had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival" as cited by Bury and Luckenbach, 1978. This record is categorized as "failed" in status, meaning the species did not establish a population in this location. The occurrence is classified as a "native transplant" with the potential pathway being a "released pet." This confirms the information mentioned in Step 0 about the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas being in California in 1954.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Check for any earlier occurrences in USGS records that might predate the 1954 California finding (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've thoroughly researched the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database and confirmed that the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) was in California in 1954. This alligator was found in the Colorado River, specifically in the Imperial Reservoir drainage.

The database entry (Specimen ID: 156000) confirms this 1954 occurrence and indicates it was marked as "failed," suggesting the introduction was unsuccessful. According to the USGS species profile page, this alligator "had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival" as referenced by Bury and Luckenbach.

I've systematically checked for any earlier occurrences in all states west of Texas (AZ, CA, CO, ID, MT, NM, NV, OR, UT, WA, WY) and confirmed that there are no earlier records than the 1954 California record. The next earliest record is from Colorado in 1978.

This confirms that according to the USGS, 1954 is the year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).

The research has been thorough, checking all states west of Texas for any potential earlier occurrences, and has confirmed that 1954 is indeed the earliest documented year according to USGS records.

Plan: Research When American Alligator Was First Found West of Texas According to USGS
=======================================================================================

Progress: 4/4 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the natural geographic range of American Alligators to understand their historical distribution
   Notes: I've identified the natural geographic range of American Alligators according to USGS data. The indigenous range extends from coastal North Carolina south to Florida and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma. This does not include any states west of Texas.

Additionally, I found that according to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database, the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) was in California in 1954. This was an alligator collected from the Colorado River that had been released from a traveling carnival. This occurrence is classified as "collected (not established)" meaning it was an isolated incident rather than evidence of a natural population.

Other western states with documented alligator occurrences include Colorado (1978), Arizona (1990), and Idaho (2009), all of which were also isolated incidents of released or escaped captive animals rather than established populations.

This information will help inform the next steps of researching which states/regions west of Texas might have alligator populations or sightings.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Verify the 1954 California finding in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I have verified the 1954 California finding in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database. According to the database, an American alligator was found in the Colorado River in California in 1954. The database specifically notes that this alligator "had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival" as cited by Bury and Luckenbach, 1978. This record is categorized as "failed" in status, meaning the species did not establish a population in this location. The occurrence is classified as a "native transplant" with the potential pathway being a "released pet." This confirms the information mentioned in Step 0 about the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas being in California in 1954.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Check for any earlier occurrences in USGS records that might predate the 1954 California finding (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've thoroughly researched the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database and confirmed that the earliest documented occurrence of an American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) was in California in 1954. This alligator was found in the Colorado River, specifically in the Imperial Reservoir drainage.

The database entry (Specimen ID: 156000) confirms this 1954 occurrence and indicates it was marked as "failed," suggesting the introduction was unsuccessful. According to the USGS species profile page, this alligator "had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival" as referenced by Bury and Luckenbach.

I've systematically checked for any earlier occurrences in all states west of Texas (AZ, CA, CO, ID, MT, NM, NV, OR, UT, WA, WY) and confirmed that there are no earlier records than the 1954 California record. The next earliest record is from Colorado in 1978.

This confirms that according to the USGS, 1954 is the year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Formulate a clear answer citing the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (depends on: 0, 1, 2)
   Notes: Based on thorough research of the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database, I've confirmed that according to the USGS, the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas) in 1954 in California. Specifically, an American alligator was documented in the Colorado River in California in 1954. This record (Specimen ID: 156000) is categorized in the USGS database as a "failed" introduction, indicating it did not establish a breeding population. The database notes this alligator "had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival" as referenced in scientific literature. The location is recorded as the Imperial Reservoir drainage of the Colorado River. I've verified that there are no earlier USGS records of American Alligators in any states west of Texas prior to this 1954 California occurrence.

This record (Specimen ID: 156000) is categorized in the USGS database as a "failed" introduction, indicating it did not establish a breeding population. The database notes this alligator "had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival" as referenced in scientific literature. The location is recorded as the Imperial Reservoir drainage of the Colorado River. I've verified that there are no earlier USGS records of American Alligators in any states west of Texas prior to this 1954 California occurrence.
