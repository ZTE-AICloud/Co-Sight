Step 2: Determining which gender number is larger
Looking at the data from Step 1:
- Women with tertiary education: 791.8 thousand
- Men with tertiary education: 556.9 thousand
Clearly, the number of women with tertiary education (791.8 thousand) is larger than the number of men (556.9 thousand).

Step 3: Calculating the difference between the larger and smaller number
The difference is: 791.8 - 556.9 = 234.9 thousand

Step 4: Converting the difference to thousands of women
Since women have the larger number, the difference is already in thousands of women: 234.9 thousand

Step 5: Formatting the final answer as a number without units
