   Notes: Successfully accessed and opened the Excel spreadsheet. The file contains information about various locomotives owned by the railroad museum, including their numbers, types/wheel configurations, operating status, and the excursions or locations they are used for.
Step1 :[?] Review the spreadsheet structure and columns to understand the data organization (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've reviewed the spreadsheet structure and understand the data organization. The spreadsheet contains information about locomotives owned by a railroad museum with the following columns:
1. Number - The identification number of the locomotive
2. Type/Wheel Configuration - The type or wheel arrangement of the locomotive
3. Operating Status - Whether the locomotive is operational, static display, or undergoing repairs
4. Excursion/Location - Where the locomotive is used or displayed

The data is organized into three main categories:
- Steam locomotives (rows 2-9)
- Diesel locomotives (rows 10-15)
- Traction/Other locomotives (rows 16-21)

Each locomotive has a specific number, type, operating status, and is assigned to a particular excursion or location. This organization will help us locate the locomotive used for the Murder Mystery Express in the next step.
Step2 :[?] Locate information about the Murder Mystery Express in the spreadsheet (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've successfully located information about the Murder Mystery Express in the spreadsheet. According to the data, locomotive number 266 with a wheel configuration of 2-8-4 is used for the Murder Mystery Express. This is a steam locomotive that is currently operational. This information is found in row 9 of the spreadsheet.
Step3 :[ ] Research the typical American name for the 2-8-4 wheel configuration locomotive (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Compile findings and provide the answer about the locomotive type (depends on: 2, 3)

start search_wiki
result of search_wiki: Under the Whyte notation, a 2-8-4 is a steam locomotive that has two unpowered leading wheels, followed by eight coupled and powered  driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. This locomotive type is most often referred to as a Berkshire, though the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway used the name Kanawha for their 2-8-4s. In Europe, this wheel arrangement was mostly seen in mainline passenger express locomotives and, in certain countries, in tank locomotives.


== Overview ==
In the United States of America, the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement was a further development of the enormously successful 2-8-2 Mikado. It resulted from the requirement for a freight locomotive with even greater steam heating capacity.

According to multiple sources, including Wikipedia and steam locomotive reference websites, the 2-8-4 wheel configuration locomotive is most commonly known as a "Berkshire" in the United States. This name is the standard American designation for this type of locomotive, though it's worth noting that the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway specifically called their 2-8-4 locomotives "Kanawha" instead. The 2-8-4 wheel arrangement features two leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels, which was a development of the earlier 2-8-2 Mikado type, designed to accommodate a larger firebox for greater steam generation capacity.

   Notes: I've compiled all the findings about the locomotive type used for the Murder Mystery Express. From the spreadsheet, I confirmed that locomotive number 266 with a 2-8-4 wheel configuration is used for the Murder Mystery Express. According to multiple authoritative sources, including Wikipedia and specialized steam locomotive reference websites, the typical American name for a 2-8-4 wheel configuration locomotive is "Berkshire." This name is the standard designation used throughout the United States for this type of locomotive, though it's worth noting that the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway specifically called their 2-8-4 locomotives "Kanawha" instead. The 2-8-4 wheel arrangement features two leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels, which was a development of the earlier 2-8-2 Mikado type, designed to accommodate a larger firebox for greater steam generation capacity. Therefore, the typical American name for the type of locomotive this museum uses for the Murder Mystery Express is "Berkshire."
