result of search_wiki: Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F).

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the image to identify the ice cream product
   Notes: Analyzed the image of the ice cream product. It's Ben & Jerry's ice cream. The nutrition facts show 21g of total fat per serving (1/3 cup), with 11g of saturated fat. This information will be useful for determining the butterfat content, but I need to research the US federal standards first to make the comparison.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research US federal standards for ice cream butterfat content as of 2020 according to Wikipedia
   Notes: Research findings:
- According to US federal standards, ice cream must contain at least 10% butterfat (milkfat) to be legally labeled as ice cream.
- This information is consistent across multiple sources including the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service.
- The 10% minimum butterfat content was the standard as of 2020 according to our research.
- The image shows a Ben & Jerry's ice cream pint, which we'll need to analyze further to determine its specific butterfat content.

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the image to identify the ice cream product
   Notes: Analyzed the image of the ice cream product. It's Ben & Jerry's ice cream. The nutrition facts show 21g of total fat per serving (1/3 cup), with 11g of saturated fat. This information will be useful for determining the butterfat content, but I need to research the US federal standards first to make the comparison.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research US federal standards for ice cream butterfat content as of 2020 according to Wikipedia (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Research findings:
- According to US federal standards, ice cream must contain at least 10% butterfat (milkfat) to be legally labeled as ice cream.
- This information is consistent across multiple sources including the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service.
- The 10% minimum butterfat content was the standard as of 2020 according to our research.
- The image shows a Ben & Jerry's ice cream pint, which we'll need to analyze further to determine its specific butterfat content.

Next steps:
- Proceed to Step 2 to determine the butterfat content of the Ben & Jerry's ice cream shown in the image.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Calculate the butterfat content of the Ben & Jerry's ice cream from the nutrition facts (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I analyzed the nutrition facts from the Ben & Jerry's ice cream image and calculated its butterfat content. The ice cream contains 11g of saturated fat per 144g serving, which calculates to approximately 7.64% butterfat content. This calculation is based on the understanding that in ice cream, the saturated fat content closely approximates the butterfat content. Multiple sources confirm that the US federal standard for ice cream requires a minimum of 10% butterfat content. This information will be used in the next step to calculate the percentage difference from the federal standard.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Calculate the percentage difference between the product's butterfat content and the federal standard (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I calculated the percentage difference between the product's butterfat content and the federal standard:

- Federal standard for butterfat content: 10.0%
- Product's butterfat content: 7.64%
- Difference: -2.36%
- Percentage difference: (7.64 - 10.0) / 10.0 * 100 = -23.6%

The ice cream is 23.6% below the federal standard for butterfat content. This calculation is now complete and ready for formatting in the next step.
