Plan: Research When St. Thomas Aquinas' Picture Was First Added to Wikipedia's Principle of Double Effect Page
===============================================================================================================

Progress: 3/8 steps completed (37.5%)
Status: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 5 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Access the Wikipedia page for 'Principle of double effect'
   Notes: Successfully accessed the Wikipedia page for 'Principle of double effect'. The page exists and contains information about the principle, including references to Thomas Aquinas. Now I need to navigate to the page history to track when St. Thomas Aquinas' picture was first added.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Navigate to the page history/revision section (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully navigated to the revision history page of the Wikipedia article on the Principle of double effect. The history page shows all past edits to the article, which I will now review to identify when St. Thomas Aquinas' picture was first added.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Review the revision history chronologically from oldest to newest (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully reviewed the revision history of the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect chronologically from oldest to newest. I identified that revision 271766439 from February 19, 2009 by user LightSpectra was significant as it added a template that included an image of St. Thomas Aquinas.
Details: 
Step3 :[ ] Identify the first revision that added an image of St. Thomas Aquinas (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Verify the image is specifically of St. Thomas Aquinas (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Note the exact date of this revision in DD/MM/YYYY format (depends on: 3)
Step6 :[ ] Double-check findings by comparing the revision before and after the addition (depends on: 3, 4, 5)
Step7 :[ ] Document the final answer in DD/MM/YYYY format (depends on: 6)

re-plan_result is I'll evaluate the current plan based on the progress so far.

The plan continues to be appropriate for the task. Step 2 has been completed successfully, and we've made significant progress by identifying a specific revision (271766439 from February 19, 2009) that appears to have added a template including an image of St. Thomas Aquinas.

The next steps remain relevant:
- Step 3 will confirm this is indeed the first revision that added the image
- Step 4 will verify the image is specifically of St. Thomas Aquinas
- Step 5 will format the date correctly
- Steps 6 and 7 will ensure accuracy and provide the final answer

Given that we've already identified a potential date (February 19, 2009) in Step 2, the remaining steps will help verify this information and format it correctly as required. The plan remains well-structured and appropriate for completing the task.

Plan: Research When St. Thomas Aquinas' Picture Was First Added to Wikipedia's Principle of Double Effect Page
===============================================================================================================

Progress: 4/8 steps completed (50.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 4 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Access the Wikipedia page for 'Principle of double effect'
   Notes: Successfully accessed the Wikipedia page for 'Principle of double effect'. The page exists and contains information about the principle, including references to Thomas Aquinas. Now I need to navigate to the page history to track when St. Thomas Aquinas' picture was first added.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Navigate to the page history/revision section (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully navigated to the revision history page of the Wikipedia article on the Principle of double effect. The history page shows all past edits to the article, which I will now review to identify when St. Thomas Aquinas' picture was first added.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Review the revision history chronologically from oldest to newest (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully reviewed the revision history of the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect chronologically from oldest to newest. I identified that revision 271766439 from February 19, 2009 by user LightSpectra was significant as it added a template that included an image of St. Thomas Aquinas.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the first revision that added an image of St. Thomas Aquinas (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Successfully identified the first revision that added an image of St. Thomas Aquinas to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect. This was revision 271766439 from February 19, 2009 by user LightSpectra. The revision added a template/infobox titled 'Part of a series on Thomas Aquinas' which included the image of St. Thomas Aquinas in the sidebar. This was confirmed by comparing with the previous revision where the image was not present.
Details: 
Step4 :[ ] Verify the image is specifically of St. Thomas Aquinas (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Note the exact date of this revision in DD/MM/YYYY format (depends on: 3)
Step6 :[ ] Double-check findings by comparing the revision before and after the addition (depends on: 3, 4, 5)
Step7 :[ ] Document the final answer in DD/MM/YYYY format (depends on: 6)

re-plan_result is I'll evaluate the current plan based on the progress so far.

The plan continues to be appropriate for the task. We've now completed Step 3, which has confirmed that revision 271766439 from February 19, 2009 by user LightSpectra was indeed the first revision that added an image of St. Thomas Aquinas to the Wikipedia page. This was done through a template/infobox titled 'Part of a series on Thomas Aquinas' which included the image in the sidebar.

The remaining steps are still relevant:
- Step 4 will verify the image is specifically of St. Thomas Aquinas
- Step 5 will format the date correctly in DD/MM/YYYY format
- Step 6 will double-check our findings
- Step 7 will document the final answer

Since we've already identified the specific revision and date, and have confirmed it by comparing with the previous revision, the plan remains well-structured and appropriate for completing the task.
