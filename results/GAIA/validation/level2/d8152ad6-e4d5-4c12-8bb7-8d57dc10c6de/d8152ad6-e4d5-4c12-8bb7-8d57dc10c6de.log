re-plan_result is I'll continue with the plan execution based on the information provided. The first step has been completed, and I can now proceed with the remaining steps.

Let me continue with the plan as it is appropriate for solving this problem. The steps are well-structured and will lead to the correct answer. No adjustments are needed at this time.

For Step 1, I need to calculate the size of each file:
- We know that 60 files exceeded the 2,000 GB limit by 100 GB
- This means the total storage used is 2,100 GB
- Each file must be the same size
- To calculate the size per file: 2,100 GB ÷ 60 files = 35 GB per file

For Step 2, I need to determine the total storage needed:
- Total files: 60 (uploaded) + 980 (remaining) = 1,040 files
- Size per file: 35 GB
- Total storage needed: 1,040 files × 35 GB = 36,400 GB (or 36.4 TB)

For Step 3, I need to identify the minimum possible plan upgrade:
- Current plan (Standard): 2 TB (2,000 GB)
- Total storage needed: 36.4 TB (36,400 GB)
- Available plans:
  * Plus Plan: 10 TB (10,000 GB) - Not enough
  * Premium Plan: 50 TB (50,000 GB) - Sufficient
- The minimum possible plan upgrade is the Premium Plan with 50 TB

For Step 4, I need to calculate the price difference:
- Standard Plan: $9.99 per month
- Premium Plan: $39.99 per month
- Price difference: $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00 per month

For Step 5, I need to calculate the average additional cost per file:
- Files exceeding the current plan limit: 1,040 files - (2,000 GB ÷ 35 GB per file) = 1,040 - 57.14 ≈ 983 files
- Additional cost: $30.00
- Average additional cost per file: $30.00 ÷ 983 files ≈ $0.0305 per file

For Step 6, I need to format the answer as requested:
- Rounding $0.0305 to the nearest cent: $0.03

Therefore, the average additional cost per file in dollars that goes over the current plan limit, rounded to the nearest cent, is:

re-plan_result is The plan is progressing well and doesn't need adjustment. Let me continue with the execution of the remaining steps.

For Step 2, I need to determine the total storage needed for all 1,040 files:
- We have 1,040 files in total (60 uploaded + 980 remaining)
- Each file is 35 GB in size (as calculated in Step 1)
- Total storage needed = 1,040 files × 35 GB = 36,400 GB (or 36.4 TB)

For Step 3, I need to identify the minimum possible plan upgrade:
- Current plan (Standard): 2 TB (2,000 GB)
- Total storage needed: 36.4 TB (36,400 GB)
- Available plans:
  * Plus Plan: 10 TB (10,000 GB) - Not enough
  * Premium Plan: 50 TB (50,000 GB) - Sufficient
- The minimum possible plan upgrade is the Premium Plan with 50 TB storage

For Step 4, I need to calculate the price difference:
- Standard Plan: $9.99 per month
- Premium Plan: $39.99 per month
- Price difference: $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00 per month

For Step 5, I need to calculate the average additional cost per file:
- First, I need to determine how many files can be stored within the Standard plan limit:
  * Standard plan limit: 2,000 GB
  * Files that fit within limit: 2,000 GB ÷ 35 GB = 57.14 files ≈ 57 files
- Files exceeding the current plan limit: 1,040 - 57 = 983 files
- Additional cost: $30.00
- Average additional cost per file: $30.00 ÷ 983 files ≈ $0.0305 per file

For Step 6, I need to format the answer as requested:
- Rounding $0.0305 to the nearest cent: $0.03

Therefore, the average additional cost per file in dollars that goes over the current plan limit, rounded to the nearest cent, is:

Plan: Calculate Average Additional Cost Per File for Storage Upgrade
=====================================================================

Progress: 5/7 steps completed (71.4%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the image to identify the Standard plan details and current storage limit
   Notes: Based on the image analysis, I've identified the following pricing plans:

1. Standard Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $9.99
   - Storage limit: 2 TB (2,000 GB)
   - Users: 1
   - Linked devices: 3
   - File backup: 30 days

2. Plus Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $19.99
   - Storage limit: 10 TB (10,000 GB)
   - Users: 2
   - Linked devices: 10
   - File backup: 60 days

3. Premium Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $39.99
   - Storage limit: 50 TB (50,000 GB)
   - Users: 10
   - Linked devices: Unlimited
   - File backup: 180 days

The current plan is the Standard plan with a 2 TB (2,000 GB) storage limit.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Calculate the size of each file based on the information that 60 files exceeded the limit by 100GB (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've calculated the size of each file based on the given information:

1. The Standard plan has a 2,000 GB (2 TB) storage limit
2. 60 equally sized files were uploaded and exceeded the limit by 100 GB
3. Total storage used by these 60 files = 2,000 GB + 100 GB = 2,100 GB
4. Size of each file = 2,100 GB ÷ 60 files = 35 GB per file

Each file is 35 GB in size. This information will be used in the next step to determine the total storage needed for all 1,040 files.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Determine the total storage needed for all 1040 files (60 uploaded + 980 remaining) (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've calculated the total storage needed for all 1040 files:

1. Each file is 35 GB in size (as determined in Step 1)
2. Total number of files = 60 (already uploaded) + 980 (remaining) = 1040 files
3. Total storage needed = 35 GB × 1040 files = 36,400 GB
4. Converting to TB: 36,400 GB = 36.4 TB

This total storage requirement (36.4 TB) will be used in the next step to determine the minimum plan upgrade needed.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the minimum possible plan upgrade needed to accommodate the total storage requirement (depends on: 0, 2)
   Notes: Based on the total storage requirement of 36.4 TB calculated in Step 2, I need to identify the minimum plan that can accommodate this storage need.

Looking at the available plans:
1. Standard Plan: 2 TB storage (current plan)
2. Plus Plan: 10 TB storage
3. Premium Plan: 50 TB storage

Since 36.4 TB exceeds both the Standard Plan (2 TB) and the Plus Plan (10 TB), the minimum possible plan upgrade needed is the Premium Plan with 50 TB of storage.

The Premium Plan is the only option that provides sufficient storage capacity (50 TB) to accommodate the total requirement of 36.4 TB for all 1040 files.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Calculate the price difference between the current Standard plan and the required upgraded plan (depends on: 0, 3)
   Notes: I've calculated the price difference between the current Standard plan and the required upgraded plan:

1. Current Standard Plan monthly cost: $9.99
2. Required Premium Plan monthly cost: $39.99 (as determined in Step 3)
3. Monthly price difference = $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00

The additional monthly cost for upgrading from the Standard Plan to the Premium Plan is $30.00. This information will be used in the next step to calculate the average additional cost per file.

Plan: Calculate Average Additional Cost Per File for Storage Upgrade
=====================================================================

Progress: 6/7 steps completed (85.7%)
Status: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the image to identify the Standard plan details and current storage limit
   Notes: Based on the image analysis, I've identified the following pricing plans:

1. Standard Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $9.99
   - Storage limit: 2 TB (2,000 GB)
   - Users: 1
   - Linked devices: 3
   - File backup: 30 days

2. Plus Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $19.99
   - Storage limit: 10 TB (10,000 GB)
   - Users: 2
   - Linked devices: 10
   - File backup: 60 days

3. Premium Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $39.99
   - Storage limit: 50 TB (50,000 GB)
   - Users: 10
   - Linked devices: Unlimited
   - File backup: 180 days

The current plan is the Standard plan with a 2 TB (2,000 GB) storage limit.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Calculate the size of each file based on the information that 60 files exceeded the limit by 100GB (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've calculated the size of each file based on the given information:

1. The Standard plan has a 2,000 GB (2 TB) storage limit
2. 60 equally sized files were uploaded and exceeded the limit by 100 GB
3. Total storage used by these 60 files = 2,000 GB + 100 GB = 2,100 GB
4. Size of each file = 2,100 GB ÷ 60 files = 35 GB per file

Each file is 35 GB in size. This information will be used in the next step to determine the total storage needed for all 1,040 files.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Determine the total storage needed for all 1040 files (60 uploaded + 980 remaining) (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've calculated the total storage needed for all 1040 files:

1. Each file is 35 GB in size (as determined in Step 1)
2. Total number of files = 60 (already uploaded) + 980 (remaining) = 1040 files
3. Total storage needed = 35 GB × 1040 files = 36,400 GB
4. Converting to TB: 36,400 GB = 36.4 TB

This total storage requirement (36.4 TB) will be used in the next step to determine the minimum plan upgrade needed.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the minimum possible plan upgrade needed to accommodate the total storage requirement (depends on: 0, 2)
   Notes: Based on the total storage requirement of 36.4 TB calculated in Step 2, I need to identify the minimum plan that can accommodate this storage need.

Looking at the available plans:
1. Standard Plan: 2 TB storage (current plan)
2. Plus Plan: 10 TB storage
3. Premium Plan: 50 TB storage

Since 36.4 TB exceeds both the Standard Plan (2 TB) and the Plus Plan (10 TB), the minimum possible plan upgrade needed is the Premium Plan with 50 TB of storage.

The Premium Plan is the only option that provides sufficient storage capacity (50 TB) to accommodate the total requirement of 36.4 TB for all 1040 files.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Calculate the price difference between the current Standard plan and the required upgraded plan (depends on: 0, 3)
   Notes: I've calculated the price difference between the current Standard plan and the required upgraded plan:

1. Current Standard Plan monthly cost: $9.99
2. Required Premium Plan monthly cost: $39.99 (as determined in Step 3)
3. Monthly price difference = $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00

The additional monthly cost for upgrading from the Standard Plan to the Premium Plan is $30.00. This information will be used in the next step to calculate the average additional cost per file.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Calculate the average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit (depends on: 2, 4)
   Notes: I've calculated the average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit:

1. First, I determined how many files can fit within the Standard plan limit:
   - Standard plan limit: 2,000 GB
   - File size: 35 GB per file
   - Files that fit within limit = 2,000 GB ÷ 35 GB = 57.14 files

2. Then I calculated how many files exceed the Standard plan limit:
   - Total files: 1,040
   - Files within limit: 57.14
   - Files exceeding limit = 1,040 - 57.14 = 982.86 files

3. Finally, I calculated the average additional cost per file that exceeds the limit:
   - Monthly price difference: $30.00
   - Files exceeding limit: 982.86
   - Average additional cost per file = $30.00 ÷ 982.86 = $0.030523 per file

The average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit is $0.030523, which rounds to $0.03 per file.

Plan: Calculate Average Additional Cost Per File for Storage Upgrade
=====================================================================

Progress: 7/7 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Analyze the image to identify the Standard plan details and current storage limit
   Notes: Based on the image analysis, I've identified the following pricing plans:

1. Standard Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $9.99
   - Storage limit: 2 TB (2,000 GB)
   - Users: 1
   - Linked devices: 3
   - File backup: 30 days

2. Plus Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $19.99
   - Storage limit: 10 TB (10,000 GB)
   - Users: 2
   - Linked devices: 10
   - File backup: 60 days

3. Premium Plan:
   - Monthly cost: $39.99
   - Storage limit: 50 TB (50,000 GB)
   - Users: 10
   - Linked devices: Unlimited
   - File backup: 180 days

The current plan is the Standard plan with a 2 TB (2,000 GB) storage limit.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Calculate the size of each file based on the information that 60 files exceeded the limit by 100GB (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've calculated the size of each file based on the given information:

1. The Standard plan has a 2,000 GB (2 TB) storage limit
2. 60 equally sized files were uploaded and exceeded the limit by 100 GB
3. Total storage used by these 60 files = 2,000 GB + 100 GB = 2,100 GB
4. Size of each file = 2,100 GB ÷ 60 files = 35 GB per file

Each file is 35 GB in size. This information will be used in the next step to determine the total storage needed for all 1,040 files.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Determine the total storage needed for all 1040 files (60 uploaded + 980 remaining) (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've calculated the total storage needed for all 1040 files:

1. Each file is 35 GB in size (as determined in Step 1)
2. Total number of files = 60 (already uploaded) + 980 (remaining) = 1040 files
3. Total storage needed = 35 GB × 1040 files = 36,400 GB
4. Converting to TB: 36,400 GB = 36.4 TB

This total storage requirement (36.4 TB) will be used in the next step to determine the minimum plan upgrade needed.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the minimum possible plan upgrade needed to accommodate the total storage requirement (depends on: 0, 2)
   Notes: Based on the total storage requirement of 36.4 TB calculated in Step 2, I need to identify the minimum plan that can accommodate this storage need.

Looking at the available plans:
1. Standard Plan: 2 TB storage (current plan)
2. Plus Plan: 10 TB storage
3. Premium Plan: 50 TB storage

Since 36.4 TB exceeds both the Standard Plan (2 TB) and the Plus Plan (10 TB), the minimum possible plan upgrade needed is the Premium Plan with 50 TB of storage.

The Premium Plan is the only option that provides sufficient storage capacity (50 TB) to accommodate the total requirement of 36.4 TB for all 1040 files.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Calculate the price difference between the current Standard plan and the required upgraded plan (depends on: 0, 3)
   Notes: I've calculated the price difference between the current Standard plan and the required upgraded plan:

1. Current Standard Plan monthly cost: $9.99
2. Required Premium Plan monthly cost: $39.99 (as determined in Step 3)
3. Monthly price difference = $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00

The additional monthly cost for upgrading from the Standard Plan to the Premium Plan is $30.00. This information will be used in the next step to calculate the average additional cost per file.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Calculate the average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit (depends on: 2, 4)
   Notes: I've calculated the average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit:

1. First, I determined how many files can fit within the Standard plan limit:
   - Standard plan limit: 2,000 GB
   - File size: 35 GB per file
   - Files that fit within limit = 2,000 GB ÷ 35 GB = 57.14 files

2. Then I calculated how many files exceed the Standard plan limit:
   - Total files: 1,040
   - Files within limit: 57.14
   - Files exceeding limit = 1,040 - 57.14 = 982.86 files

3. Finally, I calculated the average additional cost per file that exceeds the limit:
   - Monthly price difference: $30.00
   - Files exceeding limit: 982.86
   - Average additional cost per file = $30.00 ÷ 982.86 = $0.030523 per file

The average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit is $0.030523, which rounds to $0.03 per file.
Details: 
Step6 :[?] Format the answer as requested (x.xx dollars, rounded to the nearest cent) (depends on: 5)
   Notes: I've formatted the answer as requested:

1. From Step 5, we calculated that the average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit is $0.030523.

2. Rounding to the nearest cent:
   - $0.030523 rounds to $0.03 (3 cents)

3. Formatting in the requested format (x.xx):
   - The answer is 0.03

Therefore, the average additional cost per file in dollars that goes over the current plan limit, rounded to the nearest cent, is $0.03.

To solve this problem, I need to find the average additional cost per file that exceeds the current plan limit.

Given information:
- Current plan: Standard plan with 2 TB (2,000 GB) storage limit
- 60 equally sized files were uploaded and exceeded the limit by 100 GB
- 980 more files of the same size need to be uploaded
- Need to find the minimum possible plan upgrade to store all files

Step 1: Calculate the size of each file
- Total storage used by 60 files = 2,000 GB + 100 GB = 2,100 GB
- Size per file = 2,100 GB ÷ 60 files = 35 GB per file

Step 2: Calculate total storage needed for all files
- Total files = 60 + 980 = 1,040 files
- Total storage needed = 35 GB × 1,040 files = 36,400 GB (36.4 TB)

Step 3: Identify the minimum plan upgrade needed
- Standard Plan: 2 TB (not enough)
- Plus Plan: 10 TB (not enough)
- Premium Plan: 50 TB (sufficient)
- The minimum plan upgrade needed is the Premium Plan

Step 4: Calculate the price difference
- Standard Plan: $9.99/month
- Premium Plan: $39.99/month
- Price difference = $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00/month

Step 5: Calculate how many files exceed the current plan limit
- Files that fit within Standard plan = 2,000 GB ÷ 35 GB = 57.14 files
- Files exceeding the limit = 1,040 - 57.14 = 982.86 files

Step 6: Calculate the average additional cost per file
- Average additional cost = $30.00 ÷ 982.86 files = $0.030523 per file
- Rounded to the nearest cent: $0.03

The question asks for the answer in the format x.xx, so the final answer is 0.03.
