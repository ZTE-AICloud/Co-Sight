Abstract
Viruses infecting wild flora may have asignificant negative impact onnearby crops, and
vice-versa. Only limited information isavailable onwild species able tohost economicall y
important viruses thatinfect sweetpotatoes (Ipomoea batatas). Inthisstudy, Sweet potato
chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV; Carlavirus, Betaflexiviridae )andSweet potato chlorotic stunt
virus (SPCSV; Crinivirus, Closteroviridae) were surveyed inwild plants offamily Convo-
lvulaceae (genera Astripomoea, Ipomoea, Hewittia andLepistemon) inUganda. Plants
belonging to26wild species, including annuals, biannuals andperennials from four agro-
ecological zones, were observed forvirus-like symptoms in2004 and2007 andsampled for
virus testing. SPCFV was detected in84(2.9%) of2864 plants tested from 17species.
SPCSV was detected in66(5.4%) ofthe1224 plants from 12species sampled in2007.
Some SPCSV-infected plants were also infected with Sweet potato feathery mottle virus
(SPFMV; Potyvirus, Potyviridae; 1.3%), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV; Ipomo-
virus, Potyviridae; 0.5%) orboth (0.4%), butnone ofthese three viruses were detected in
SPCFV-infected plants. Co-infection ofSPFMV with SPMMV was detected in1.2% ofplants
sampled. Virus-like symptoms were observed in367wild plants (12.8%), ofwhich 42plants
(11.4%) were negative fortheviruses tested. Almost all(92.4%) the419sweetpotato plants
sampled from fields close tothetested wild plants displayed virus-like symptoms, and
87.1% were infected with oneormore ofthefour viruses. Phylogenetic andevolutionary
analyses ofthe30-proximal genomic region ofSPCFV, including thesilencing suppressor
(NaBP)- andcoat protein (CP)-coding regions implicated strong purifying selection on
theCPandNaBP, andthattheSPCFV strains from East Africa aredistinguishable from
those from other continents .However, thestrains from wild species andsweetpotato were

Introduction
There isevidence that wild flora acts asareservoir ofviruses causing significant losses in
nearby crops and vice versa [1±7]. However, information about viruses inwild species isstill
quite limited. This may inpart beduetothefactthat viral infections inwild plants areoften
symptomless, even when thesame infection may have obvious symptoms incultivated plants
[8±10]. Whether thesame virus strains caninfect wild and cultivated plants, butarebetter
adapted towild plants and hence cause nosymptoms, isanissue requiring further study [11,
12]. The geospatial distribution and genetic variability ofviruses inwild species isalso poorly
understood [13, 14]. Although some metagenomic surveys have explored virus diversity in
wild plant communities [14±19], only afewstudies have described thegenetic variability of
individual virus species inwild plants inrelation toisolates found incultivated plants [20±27].
Moreover, fewstudies have compared isolates ofplant viruses from wild and cultivated hosts
across broad geographical areas [22±24, 28±30]. Thus, studies comparing virus populations in
weeds orwild species and crop species that share anagro-ecological interface areneeded to
gain insights into theevolutionary and ecological dynamics ofplant virus populations, which
inturn areneeded tofacilitate plant virus disease management [8,31,32].
The incidence and impact ofplant viruses attheagro-ecological interface areoften exacer-
bated inevergreen tropical environments, where susceptible cultivated and wild plants are
continuously available, providing thenecessary environment forviral replication and vectors
forviral transmission [30, 33,34]. Plant virus diseases notonly have aneconomic impact but
also may cause starvation, especially when thecultivated host plant constitutes a`food security'
crop [35±38]. Anexample isthesweetpotato, IpomoeabasasaS (L.)Lam., theworld's third-
most-important root crop and acritical food security crop insub-Saharan Africa [38±40].
Globally, over 30viruses areknown toinfect sweetpotatoes [41±43].
Sweetpotatoes aregrown asaperennial crop inlocal cropping systems inUganda and else-
where inEast Africa. Sources ofhealthy planting materials arelimited [44, 45]. Perreniality
and lack ofhealthy sweetpotato planting materials coupled with theabundance ofinsect vec-
tors transmitting theviruses promotes yield losses duetovirus diseases [46]. The most severe
yield losses occur insweetpotato plants co-infected with thewhitefly-transmitte dwceesposaso
hlrouosnhSsvCsfnuvS (SPCSV; genusyunCnfnuvS, family Closteroviridae) and theaphid-transmit-
tedwceesposasoPeasleudmossrefnuvS (SPFMV; genus-osdfnuvS, family Potyviridae). Co-infec-
tion with these viruses results inso-called Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), characterized by
leafmalformation, stunted plants and nearly complete lossofyields [47±50]. Similar but
milder symptoms develop insweetpotato plants co-infected with SPCSV andwceesposaso
hlrouosnhPrehBfnuvS (SPCFV; genusyaurafnuvS, family Betaflexiviridae), wceesposasomnrgmosA
srefnuvS (SPMMV; genusIpomofnuvS; family Potyviridae) [49, 51]orsweepoviruses (genus
HeLomofnuvS, family Geminiviridae) [52]. The frequent co-infection ofsweetpotatoes with
SPCFV and SPFMV suggests that these viruses may betransmitted byacommon vector [53,
54], butthevector ofSPCFV remains tobeidentified [55]. Whiteflies transmit sweepoviruses
and were also initially reported asvectors ofSPMMV [56], butthese results could notbecon-
firmed inlater studies [55].
Previous studies inUganda have shown that SPFMV, SPMMV and SPCSV from wild
plants ofthefamily Convolvulaceae arephylogenetically similar tothose found incultivated

sweetpotatoes [22±24]. SPFMV and SPMMV, respectively, were detected in24and 21wild
plant species and in23and 20districts, respectively, surveyed inthecountry [23, 57]. Further-
more, 12wild Convolvulaceae species were found tobeinfected with SPCSV [24], butthegeo-
graphical distribution ofSPCSV inwild vegetation inUganda and thewild host species and
co-infection ofSPCSV with other viruses inwild plants were notreported. Similarly, informa-
tion regarding SPCFV infection inwild plants ofConvolulacea islacking, even though SPCFV
occurs sweetpotatoes inUganda [58] and other East African countries such asKenya [53, 59],
Tanzania [60] and Rwanda [61], aswell aswestern Africa [62], Asia, Australia, East Timor and
Latin America [54, 63±66].
The aimofthisstudy wastodetermine theincidence ofSPCFV andSPCSV andtheir rates of
co-infection with SPFMV andSPMMV, inwild species interfacing with cultivated sweetpotatoes
inthemajor agro-ecological zones ofUganda, andtostudy thegenetic variability ofSPCFV.
Results
Virus-like symptoms inwild plants
Atotal of2864 wild plants ofthefamily Convolvulaceae (generaFSsunpomoea, Necnssna, IpoA
moea andTepnSsemoC) were sampled from their natural habitats infour agro-ecological zones
inUganda where sweetpotato crops aregrown (Figs 1and 2,S1Table). The natural habitats of
thewild plants surveyed were inclose proximity (within 500m)tocultivated sweetpotato
fields. The wild plants were observed totrail into thesweetpotato fields, especially inthewest-
ern(Fig 2A), central (Fig 2B)and eastern (Fig 2C)zones. Some wild plants grew asweeds in
sweetpotato fields intheeastern zone (Fig 2D). Volunteer sweetpotato plants were found
growing among wild plants inthecentral zone (Fig 2E).
Virus-like symptoms were observed inatotal of367wild plants (12.8%) collected over the
twosampling years (2004 and 2007); ofthese, 42plants (11.4%) tested negative forallfour
viruses. Incontrast, 132(5.3%) of2497 symptomless wild plants tested positive foratleast one
ofthefour viruses. The symptomless butvirus-positive wild plants constituted 15.8% ofall836
wild plants that tested positive foratleast onevirus. Insweetpotatoes, 5(1.3%) ofthe387
plants with symptoms tested negative forallfour viruses. Ontheother hand, 10(31.3%) of32
symptomless plants tested positive foratleast onevirus.
Leaf chlorosis wasobserved inN.Svbrobasa (Fig 2F)and chlorotic spots were displayed inI.
seCvnuoSsunS (Fig 2G) andI.ahvmnCasa (Fig 2J)infected with SPCFV. Mild tosevere purpling of
older leaves wasobserved inplants ofI.SnCeCSnS infected with SPCSV (Fig 2Hand 2I).
Incidence ofSPCFV inwild plants
Plants showing aconsistent and unambiguous positive reaction inthree independent NCM-E-
LISA experiments were deemed SPCFV-infected. SPCFV wasdetected in84(2.9%) of2864
wild plants tested, including N.Svbrobasa, T.ocauneCSnS and 15ofthe26Ipomoea species tested
(Table 1,S1Table). Allofthese 17wild species offamily Convolvulaceae represent previously
unknown natural hosts forSPCFV. Ineleven species (I.ahvmnCasa, I.hanunha,I.eunohaupa, I.
nCforvhuasa, I.obShvua,I.SnCeCSnS,I.seCvnuoSsunS, I.cnLlsnn,FSsunpomoea ldohdamongeS, N.SvbroA
basa andT.ocauneCSnS) from which over 40plants were tested, theoverall incidence ofSPCFV
ranged from 1.8% inI.seCvnuoSsunS andI.cnLlsnn to5.2% inT.ocauneCSnS (Table 1).Notested
plants ofI.hougoPaCa, I.eunohaupa, I.PnSsvroSa, I.LuaCsnn,I.nCforvhuasa, I.pordmoupla, I.SpaslvA
rasa,I.fervsnpeS, F.LuaCsnn orF.ldohdamongeS were positive forSPCFV (Table 1).The lowest
incidence ofSPCFV inwild plants (0.7%) wasrecorded intheMasindi district inwestern
Uganda, and thehighest incidence (9.0%) wasfound intheKatakwi district ineastern Uganda
(Table 1).

SPCFV wasalso detected in17(4.1%) of419cultivated sweetpotato plants sampled from
thefour agro-ecological zones. SPFMV, SPCSV and SPMMV were detected in177(44.6%),
112(29.5%) and 59(14.0%), respectively, ofthetested sweetpotato plants.
Toallow later sequence characterization ofitsgenome, SPCFV isolates from wild plants
and sweetpotato plants were mechanically inoculated onto sweetpotato cv.Tanzania and
maintained inagreenhouse. Five SPCFV isolates were collected from wild plants, including
twofromI.ahvmnCasa (Mbale, eastern zone) and oneeach fromI.ahvmnCasa (Bushenyi, west-
ernzone),I.hanunha (Mbigi, central zone) andI.seCvnuoSsunS (Masindi, western zone). Four
SPCFV isolates were collected from sweetpotato plants, including twofrom thewestern zone
and oneeach from thecentral and northern zones.

Detection andincidence ofSPCSV inwild plants
Positive reaction with SPCSV antibodies wasobserved in66(5.4%) of1224 wild plants tested
intriplicate bytriple antibody sadwich-ezyme linked immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA)
(Table 2).Only 27% ofseropositive plants showed virus-like symptoms. SPCSV-infected plants
belonged to10Ipomoea species plusN.Svbrobasa andT.ocauneCSnS (Table 2).The SPCSV inci-
dence inspecies from which atleast 51plants were tested was9.3% inI.obShvua, 8.8% inI.hanuA
nha,7.8% inI.ahvmnCasa, 5.6% inI.SnCeCSnS, 5.5% inI.seCvnuoSsunS and 2.6% inN.Svbrobasa
(Table 2).Scions from 25SPCSV-seropositive wild plants belonging toeight species were
grafted ontoI.SesoSa. The grafted plants developed chlorotic mottling symptoms onleaves and
tested SPCSV-positive byTAS-ELISA at4wkpost-grafting. Noplants ofI.aGvasnha (12plants
tested),I.huepngnPoumnS (12),I.lnrgeubuaCgsnn (6),I.pvupvuea (14),I.uepeCS (3),F.LuaCsnn (17)
orF.ldoShdamongeS (14) tested positive forSPCSV (Table 2).
Among all1224 wild plants tested, SPCSV wasmore frequently detected inplants from the
western (1.6±11.6%) and eastern (2.7±8.4%) zones than thecentral (2.7±4.2%) zone (Table 2).
Only twoplants from Arua, oneofthetwonorthern districts, tested positive forSPCSV
(Table 2).Sixspecies (I.ahvmnCasa, I.hanunha,I.obShvua,I.seCvnuoSsnS, N.Svbrobasa andT.ocauA
neCSnS) were commonly found intheeastern, central andwestern zones andwere therefore

sampled inthelargest numbers (64% ofallplants tested). Comparison ofvirus incidence across
these three agro-ecological zones confirmed theaforementioned spatial differences inSPCSV
incidence (Table 2).SPCSV wasalso detected in105(25%) ofthe419cultivated sweetpotato
plants tested.
Mixed viral infections inwild plants
Mixed infections ofSPCFV with anyofthethree other common sweetpotato viruses, SPCSV,
SPFMV and SPMMV, wasnotfound inthewild plants tested. However, co-infections involv-
ingtheother three viruses were found, including SPCSV +SPFMV and SPCSV +SPMMV in
sixplants each outof1224 plants sampled in2007. Co-infection ofSPFMV and SPMMV was
detected in35of2864 plants sampled in2004 and 2007. Triple infection bySPCSV, SPFMV
and SPMMV wasfound in5of1224 plants sampled in2007 (Table 3).Single infections by
SPFMV and SPMMV inwild plants have been reported elsewhere [23, 57].
In419sweetpotato plants tested, SPCFV wasfound co-infecting with SPFMV (3plants),
SPCSV (3plants) orSPMMV (2plants), and with both SPFMV and SPCSV (2plants), SPFMV
and SPMMV (9plants) orSPMMV and SPCSV (1plant). Allfour viruses were detected inone
sweetpotato plant (Table 3).
Molecular variability oftheSPCFV coat protein (CP) andnucleic acid±
binding protein (NaBP) regions
The (+)ssRNA genome ofSPCFV (NCBI acc. no.AY461421) is9104 nucleotides (nt) long,
excluding the30-terminal poly(A) tail,and contains sixopen reading frames (ORFs) [67].
ORF5 encodes thecoat protein (CP). ORF6 partially overlaps the30end ofORF5 by17ntand
encodes thenucleic acid±binding protein (NaBP) [67] implicated insuppression ofantiviral
RNA silencing [68]. The length ofRT-PCR amplicons covering the30-proximal genomic
region ofSPCFV from fivewild plants and four sweetpotato plants was1578 nt.BLAST
searches intheNCBI database showed that thesequences were homologous tothe30genomic
region inthe29SPCFV isolates previously characterized from sweetpotatoes inEast Africa
(Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania), Asia (China, Taiwan, South Korea), Australia, East Timor, Peru
orofunknown origin (Table 4).The amplified sequences contained theORFs forSPCFV CP
(nt242±1138, 299aa)and NaBP (nt1125±1523, 133aa),and also the30-UTR; (nt1527±1578).
Sequences determined inthisstudy were submitted totheNCBI database under accession
numbers EF155967, EF155968 and KR086396±KR086402 (Table 4).
The nucleotide sequences ofthenine SPCFV isolates were 86.1±98.2% (CP; S2Table),
95.2±99.5% (NaBP; S3Table) and 96.4±100% (30-UTR; S4Table) identical. The fiveisolates
from wild plants were 86.2±98.2% (CP; S2Table), 95.5±99.2% (NaBP; S3Table), and 96.4±
100% (30-UTR; S4Table) identical atthenucleotide level with 15isolates from cultivated
sweetpotato inEast Africa. Among all38CP- and 32NaBP-coding sequences ofSPCFV,
including those determined inthisstudy and those available intheNCBI database, thenucleo-
tide sequence identities were 75.0±100% fortheCP(S2Table) and 77.4±100% fortheNaBP
(S3Table), and thededuced amino acid sequence identities were 88.3±100% fortheCP(S2
Table) and 75.9±100% fortheNaBP (S3Table). However, identities between SPCFV isolates
from East Africa and elsewhere were relatively low: 75.0±89.3% and 88.3±95.7% atthenucleo-
tide and amino acid level, respectively, forCP(S2Table), and 77.4±93.7% and 75.9±96.2% at
thenucleotide and amino acid level forNaBP (S3Table). NaBP ofSPCFV isacysteine-rich
protein (CRP) [68] and hasazinc finger±like motif (CX 2CX 4CX 3C)that wasobserved within
thesame protein region (aa64±98) inallnine SPCFV isolates. The arginine-rich basic motif,
RRARR, which isinvolved intheRNA silencing suppression activity ofNaBP [68] wasalso

observed inthesame position (aa59±63) inallnine SPCFV isolates. The CPofisolates
BUSH42 and KINT2 from wild plants hadunique amino acid substitutions (V/G/E/S12A and
Q119H, respectively), and theNaBP ofKINT2 hadaunique amino acid substitution (I34V).
Some amino acid sites intheCP(13E, 29E, 41Iand 118A) and NaBP (3S, 7R,23C, 74E and
95V) were conserved inisolates from East Africa butwere highly variable inisolates from Asia.
Overall, noconsistent amino acid sequence differences were associated with geographic origin
orhost species.
Recombination andphylogenetic relationships inSPCFV isolates
Noevidence forrecombination wasdetected inthe1109±1761 nt-long NaBP-CP-30-UTR
region available from 35SPCFV isolates (-=0.999) orinthecomplete genomic sequences of
theseven SPCFV isolates indicated inTable 4(-=0.071) using thesixprograms included in
theRDP4 package and thePHI test.
Using theT92+G+I nucleotide substitution model, phylogenetic clustering ofthe38
CPsequences showed nocongruence with thehost species (Fig 3A). However, there wasTable 3.Occurrence ofmixed infection swith SPCFV, SPCSV ,SPFMV and/or SPMMV inwild Convolv ulacea species and cultivat edsweetpota to

Nucleotide diversity andselection pressure ontheSPCFV CPandNaBP
Analysis ofgenetic differentiation between SPCFV populations from East Africa and Asia was
carried outforboth theCP- and NaBP-coding sequences. RSTvalues forCP(0.30011) and
NaBP (0.30064) showed evidence ofgenetic differentiation, implying that foreach oftheCP
and NaBP, 30.0% oftotal variance oftheSPCFV population isexplained bytheorigin ofiso-
lates inEast Africa orAsia. Between-population diversity wasgreater than within-population
diversity forCPand NaBP, further suggesting adifferentiated population. Forexample, the
SPCFV subpopulation from East Africa hasawithin-population diversity of0.05007±0.00590
(CP) and 0.02934±0.00482 (NaBP). However, between-populati ondiversities with theAsian
subpopulation wasmore than twotimes higher, both separately (0.11003±0.00751, Asian1
CP;0.11405±0.01952, Asian2 CP;0.08593±0.00886, Asian1 NaBP; and 0.07018±0.001704,
Asian2 NaBP) orincombination (0.15861±0.01220 fortheCPand 0.14723±0.01336 forthe
NaBP). Incontrast, theSPCFV subpopulation from outside East Africa hadwithin-population
diversities of0.15861±0.01220 (CP) and 0.14723±0.01336 (NaBP), which areonly slightly
higher than thebetween-population diversities, indicating asubpopulation structuration in
theAsian isolates. Taken together, thephylogenetic clustering ofisolates (Fig 3Aand 3B), gene
flow estimates ofRSTand within- and between-population diversity indices demonstrate
genetic differentiation ofSPCFV according togeographical origin.
Synonymous codon usage bias wasevaluated based ontheeffective number ofcodons
(ENC). Forthenuclear universal genetic code, thevalue forENC ranges from 20(ifonly one
codon isused foreach amino acid, i.e.,codon bias ismaximal) to61(ifallsynonymous codons
foreach amino acid areequally used, i.e.,there isnocodon bias). Our results showed that CP
hadahigher ENC value (53.9) than NaBP (50.1), suggesting that, although both coding regions
hadmoderate bias incodon usage, NaBP hadmore codon bias than CP.This isconsistent
with thelarger codon bias index (CBI) value found forNaBP (0.432) ascompared with CP
(0.283). CBI values range from 0(inagene with random codon usage) to1(inagene with
extreme codon bias). Thus, ourCBI results suggest that codon usage ismore random inCP
than inNaBP.
Irrespective ofthehost species from which theSPCFV isolates were characterized, nucleo-
tide diversity (π)values foreach ofthetwoprotein-coding regions were relatively low(12.1%
and 8.7% fory-andEaH-, respectively). The non-synonymous nucleotide diversity (πa)was
2.6% and 4.1% fory-andEaH-, respectively, whereas thesynonymous ntdiversity (πs)was
45.7%, and 25.2%, respectively. The ratio ofπatoπs(ω=πa/πs)gives ageneralized estimation
ofω,which isthemeasure ofselection pressure imposed onagiven entire protein. The value
ofπawas17.5- and 6.1-fold lower than thevalue ofπsfory-andEaH-, respectively, suggest-
ingtheinfluence ofpurifying selection. Under thebasic assumption that acodon isaunit of
evolutionary change [70], maximum likelihood (ML) sitemodels treatωforanycodon ina
protein-coding nucleotide sequence asarandom variable from astatistical distribution. Thus,
selection pressures suggested bytheaforementioned results and assessed byaMLframework
ofcodon substitution under model M0, which yieldedωvalues of0.044 and 0.127 fory-and
EaH-, respectively, indicate purifying selection (Table 5).The heterogeneity ofselective pres-
sure wasrevealed byalikelihood ratio test(LRT) ofM3vs.M0, which showed that theM3
model fitthedata significantly better than M0forboth CPand NaBP proteins (Table 5).M3
forNaBP suggested that 58.0% ofsites were subject tostrong purifying selection (ω=0.011),
40.5% ofsites were under weak purifying selection (ω=0.278) and only 1.4% ofsites were
under positive selection (ω=1.598) (Table 5).NaÈiveempirical Bayes inference under M3iden-
tified oneamino acid (8P) asundergoing positive selection (Table 5).M3forCPshowed that
allsites were under varying degrees ofpurifying selection asfollows: 82.7% ofsites were

subjected tonearly lethal mutations (ω=0.008), 14.5% were under weak purifying selection (ω
=0.177) and 2.7% ofsites were under nearly neutral evolution (ω=0.615) (Table 5).Inboth
CPand NaBP, likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) ofnested models M2a vs.M1a, M8vs.M7and
M8a vs.M8showed that thepositive selection models (M2a, M8and M8a) didnotfitthedata
significantly better than therespective null models (M1a, M7and M8; Table 5),which iscon-
sistent with purifying selection onmany oftheamino acid sites. Parameter estimates under

Most ofthe26tested wild species ofConvolvulaceae were found tobenatural hosts for
SPCFV, including N.Svbrobasa, T.ocauneCSnS and 15Ipomoea species. Previously, I.aGvasnha,
I.pvupvuea andI.cnLlsnn were shown tobeinfectible with SPCFV following experimental
inoculation [54], butthisstudy showed that these species canbenaturally infected with
SPCFV. Furthermore, SPCSV wasfound toinfect 12species inthefield, including N.SvbroA
basa,T.ocauneCSnS and 10wildIpomoea species. These results significantly extend ourknowl-
edge ofthenatural host ranges ofSPCSV and SPCFV.Table 5.Parameter estimates, log-likeliho od(lnL),ω-ratio (dN/dS),and likeliho odratio test (LRT) statistics under seven different maximum likeli-

SPCFV andOther Viruses inWild Plants
PLOS ONE |DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0167 769 December 22,2016 13/27
Many ofthewild plants tested contained double ortriple infections ofSPFMV, SPMMV and/
orSPCSV. These mixed infections have notbeen reported previously. However, nowild species
were co-infected with SPCFV andanyoftheother three viruses. This wasinstriking contrast to
cultivated sweetpotatoes, which arefrequently co-infected with SPCFV andoneormore ofthe
other viruses both inouranalysis andinprevious studies inEast Africa [53,58,61].Furthermore,
ourprevious studies have shown that several wild Convolvulaceae species areco-infected with
theSPFMV strains EAandCinthefield inUganda [22]. The Cstrain wasproposed tobeanew
species [71] andwasrecently designated aswceesposasofnuvSy[72]. Insweetpotatoes, theinci-
dence ofSPFMV andSPCSV infections canbeashigh as70% inUganda [58], which inturn
increases theincidence ofco-infection, development ofSPVD andsignificant yield losses.
Perennial host plants and generalist vectors ofviruses could beexpected toenhance mixed
infection. InEast Africa including Uganda, theperenniality ofsweetpotato inthelocal crop-
ping system favours accumulation ofviruses and mixed infections arecommon [42, 46]. Also,
mixed virus infections areknown inperennial wild plants, e.g., [13, 73±75]. However, whether
high incidence ofmixed virus infections could belinked totheplants' perennial orannual life-
cycle requires further study. Forexample, anannual grass species with lessresistance tovirus
infection showed ahigh potential ofacting asareservoir ofageneralist plant virus that also
infects perennial grass hosts growing inthesame habitat [2,76±79]. Furthermore, co-infection
byagroup ofvectored viral pathogens ishighest with abundant generalist vectors (which are
able totransmit multiple virus species/strains), weak cross-protection and co-infection±
induced mortality [75, 80]. Although itisknown that aphids transmit SPFMV, and whiteflies
(HemnSna sabahn andUunarevuogeS abvsnroCea) transmit SPCSV, thevectors forSPCFV and
SPMMV remain tobeconfirmed [55]. This currently limits ourability toelucidate theimpact
ofvectors onthecontrasting incidences ofmixed viral infections inwild species and sweetpo-
tatoes. However, cross-protection between anyofthevirus species inourstudy isunlikely,
because itrequires high sequence homology [81]. Therefore, themost probable explanation of
ourobserved lowincidences ofmixed infections may beinefficient vector transmission of
viruses between thewild plants orbetween cultivated and wild plants [31] and/or high levels of
virus resistance inwild species preventing infection orkeeping virus titers atundetectable lev-
els[12, 82]. Furthermore, synergistic oradditive effects ofmultiple virus infections causing
severe disease could have eliminated co-infected plants [1±2, 5,83±86]. These effects canvary
among populations [12, 87,88], species [89] and environments [75, 90,91].
Contrasting virus incidences inwild plants may beexplained bycommunity contexts and
processes [92, 93]. Forexample, intheluteovirus complex (barley and cereal yellow dwarf
viruses) inCalifornia grasslands, virus prevalence isshaped byinteractions within theplant
community and among host plants, insect vectors, herbivores and abiotic factors [92, 94±96].
Although general differences innatural vegetation types have been previously noted inUganda
[57, 58], empirical data onhost plant community composition needs tobestrengthened to
warrant testable hypotheses oncontrasting regional virus incidences inwild plants.
Observation ofdisease symptoms istheinitial step inviral disease diagnosis. Although
virus-like symptoms were observed, nocharacteristic symptoms could beassociated with a
particular virus forseveral reasons, including mixed infections and condition ofthehost. Fur-
thermore, many SPCFV- and SPCSV-infected wild plants remained symptomless, which
seems common among wild plants [5,8,13,18,89,97]. Inaddition, some symptom-expressing
plants tested negative forSPCFV, SPCSV, SPMMV and SPFMV, indicating possible infection
with other viruses that could notbedetected with theantibodies and PCR primers used dueto
assay specificities. Itseems worthwhile tocontinue these studies using generic methods, such
assmall-RNA deep sequencing, that require nopresumptions about theviruses present and
candetect alltypes ofviruses simultaneously [98±102].
SPCFV andOther Viruses inWild Plants
PLOS ONE |DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0167 769 December 22,2016 14/27
They-andEaH- sequences offiveSPCFV isolates from three wild host species and their
comparison with 11SPCFV isolates from cultivated sweetpotato inUganda revealed nearly
identical nucleotide diversity indices and nophylogenetic evidence ofdiversification because
ofthehost species. Negative selection wasimplicated intheevolution ofCPand NaBP. Nega-
tiveconstraints imposed bymutations onviral CPs may beassociated with multiple functions
such asgenome encapsidation and protection, cell-to-cell movement, transmission between
plants and host and/or vector interactions. Chare and Holmes [103] analyzed selection pres-
sures inCP-coding sequences ofplant RNA viruses and found that vector-borne viruses are
subjected togreater negative selection than non-vectored viruses. Negative selective pressure is
usually interpreted asamechanism ofpreserving thestructure and function ofproteins [70,
104]. The CPofSPCFV and other carlaviruses ismultifunctional [104±106], whereas NaBP is
acysteine-rich protein (CRP) implicated inRNA silencing suppression, nuclear localization
and viral pathogenesis [68, 107±109]. InNaBP and CP,different codon positions were sub-
jected tovarying levels ofpurifying selection, possibly toprovide abalance between theneed
tomaintain protein structure and function and theeffectiveness ofthese functions. The lack of
aCRP inthesweet potato C-6carlavirus (SPC6V) [110] may also indicate that CRPs areto
some extent redundant incarlaviruses.
Most ofthewild plants inthisstudy were collected from thevicinity ofsweetpotato fields or
grew asweeds insweetpotato fields. This makes iteasier forputative vectors totransmit viruses
between wild and cultivated hosts. Indeed, theobserved similarities and lack ofphylogenetic
congruence with wild and cultivated hosts suggests frequent exchange ofSPCFV isolates
between thewild plants and sweetpotatoes. Similarly, nophylogenetic association with any
hosts hasbeen found inthree other carlavirus species (wlarrosraseCsfnuvS,xaurnhraseCsfnuvS
andyommoC LaurnhraseCsfnuvS) infecting sixdifferent Frrnvm spp. [111]; isolates ofSPMMV,
SPFMV and SPCSV inUganda [22±24];RnhederrocmossrefnuvS (genuswobemofnuvS) inculti-
vated riceand wild graminaceous species inEast, Central and West Africa [28, 112] andFPunA
haChaSSafamoSanhfnuvS andEaSsFPunhaChaSSafamoSanhyameuooC fnuvS (genusHeLomofnuvS,
family Geminiviridae) incassava and various wild hosts inWest Africa [113].
Phylogenetic clustering ofSPCFV isolates wascongruent with their geographic origin in
East Africa orAsia, demonstrating diversification. This hasalso been shown forseveral other
economically harmful viruses infecting sweetpotato, cassava orrice, suggesting that East Africa
isacenter ofevolutionary diversification and emergence ofmany new plant viruses and virus
strains. Forexample, theEast African (EA) strain ofSPFMV (SPFMV-EA) ismainly found in
East Africa [22, 71,114±117], where itisundergoing rapid molecular adaptation compared
with other strains ofSPFMV andwceesposasofnuvS C(SPVC) [22]. Until recently, anEAstrain
ofSPCSV (SPCSV-EA) wasrestricted toEast Africa. The SPCSV-EA isolates vary inthe
presence orabsence ofacoding region forap22RNA silencing suppressor, whereas SPCSV
isolates from outside East Africa typically lack thep22[24, 42,118±120]. SPMMV isgeograph-
ically restricted toEast Africa [23, 71,121], incontrast toSPCFV, which isfound onmany
continents. Preliminary evidence suggests that SPCFV isolates from East Africa may bedistin-
guished from those occurring elsewhere byphylogenetic analysis ofy-sequences [54]. How-
ever, theinclusion ofadditional SPCFV isolates from East Africa and analysis ofy-andEaH-
sequences inthisstudy clearly showed that SPCFV isolates from East Africa form aunique
phylogenetic group. Hence, wepropose thename SPCFV-EA forthestrains typical ofEast
Africa.
Other plant viruses also seem tohave acenter ofdiversification inEast Africa.yaSSafa
buocCSsueaBfnuvS andULaCgaC haSSafabuocCSsueaBfnuvS occur inEast Africa, where they
have amodular distribution inIndian Ocean coastal areas and themainland Lake Victoria
basin [122±126]. However, they arenow spreading toother areas [127, 128]. Cassava mosaic

geminiviruses, including ahighly virulent recombinant strain, exhibit agradient ofdecreasing
prevalence (100% to38%) from eastern tosouthern Africa [129, 130].RnhederrocmossrefnuvS
exhibits phylogenetic congruence with thegeographical origin ofisolates onaneast-to-west
transect across Africa and showed decreased nucleotide diversity westward across Africa [28,
112, 131, 132]. The recently emerged strain S4ug ofthevirus inEastern Uganda isthought to
betheoutcome ofsingular interplay between strains inEast Africa and Madagascar [133].
Although there arerelatively fewcharacterized isolates ofSPCFV (C=38), thestrong phyloge-
netic affinity totheir origin inEast Africa isanother piece ofevidence implicating East Africa
asahotspot fordiversification ofimportant plant viruses.
Taken together, thecurrent study further highlights wild plants asreservoirs ofviruses in
agro-ecosystems. The four viruses detected inwild Convolvulaceae plants inUganda cause
major constraints insweetpotato production inEast Africa. Symptomless viral infections in
wild plant species were common, which istypical ofviruses inwild plants and reflects adapta-
tion [8±10, 97]. Plant viruses and their principal hosts often have common centers oforigin
[134±136]. The sweetpotato originated inCentral and/or South America and wasdispersed to
Africa and other continents only during thelast300years, although there isevidence ofprehis-
toric cultivation inAustralasia and theSouth Pacific [137±142]. Ifviruses hadbeen dispersed
along with thesweetpotato, itwould beexpected that identical isolates ofSPFMV, SPCSV,
SPMMV and SPCFV would occur worldwide. This seems tobethecase forSPFMV strains
RC, Oand C(SPVC), butapparently notforSPFMV-EA, SPCSV-EA orSPCFV-EA, which
arelargely geographically confined toEast Africa [22, 24,57,58,71,114, 143, 144], thisstudy.
The origin ofSPMMV islikely tobeEast Africa, and thesweetpotato isprobably notitspri-
mary host [23]. Hence, itseems that these sweetpotato viruses areundergoing unique pro-
cesses ofevolution and adaptation insweetpotato landraces and wild Convolvulaceae species
inEast Africa.
Materials and Materials
Field surveys andsampling
Wild plants (family Convolvulaceae; generaFSsunpomoea, Ipomoea, Necnssna andTepnSsemoC)
including annual, biannual andperennial species were observed forvirus symptoms, andatotal
of1640 and1224 plants were collected inthefour agro-ecological zones ofUganda (Fig 1)in
2004 and2007, respectively, asdescribed [57]. Allthesampling sites inallzones were onpri-
vately owned land andtheowners gave gave permission toconduct thestudy onthese sites. The
field studies didnotinvolve endangered orprotected species. Five totenleaves (preferably with
virus-like symptoms) andtwotofivecuttings (length, 10±25 cm) were sampled from each
plant. Cuttings were planted inaninsect-proof screenhouse attheMakerere University Agricul-
tural Research Institute, Kabanyolo (MUARIK), Uganda. The plants studied were mainly in
close proximity tosweetpotato cultivation orgrew asweeds insweetpotato fields. Wild plants
were identified taxonomically using keys from Verdcourt [145] andbyDNA barcoding (acces-
sion no.FJ795781-FJ795796) asdescribed [22,57].Inaddition, atotal of419cultivated sweetpo-
tato plants were sampled from fields inwhose vicinity wild plants were collected.
Serological detection ofSPCFV andSPCSV inwild plants
Todetect viruses, leafdiscs (2cmindiameter) were excised from 5±10 leaves ofaplant, com-
bined and tested bynitrocellulose membrane enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NCM-E-
LISA) using polyclonal antibodies asdescribed [57, 146]. The antibodies were provided bythe
International Potato Center (CIP), Lima, Peru. Allwild plants and sweetpotatoes were tested
forSPCFV, butonly wild plants and sweetpotatoes sampled in2007 were tested forSPCSV.
SPCFV andOther Viruses inWild Plants
PLOS ONE |DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0167 769 December 22,2016 16/27
Leaf discs were also excised asabove fortriple antibody sandwich ELISA (TAS-ELISA) for
serological testing [147] using polyclonal antibodies specific totheEAstrain ofSPCSV (anti-
bodies provided byCIP). Testing wasrepeated onplants established inthescreenhouse.
Scions of25wild plants seronegative forSPCFV, 40plants seronegative forSPCSV (but dis-
playing virus-like symptoms) and 30symptomless plants seronegative forSPCFV and SPCSV
were grafted onto 2-wk-old plants ofI.SesoSa Kerr., asensitive indicator and nearly universal
host ofsweetpotato±infect ingviruses [148, 149]. The graftedI.SesoSa plants were observed for
virus symptoms and tested serologically forSPCFV and SPCSV 3and 4wkafter grafting,
respectively, asdescribed above.
The SPCSV isolates detected inwild plants were graft-transmitted tosweetpotato plants of
cultivar `Tanzania' forease ofmaintenance and further analysis.
Molecular detection ofSPCFV andSPCSV
The presence ofSPCFV and SPCSV wasverified in5and 30seropositive samples, respectively,
byRT-PCR. Total RNA wasextracted from 200mgleaftissue using TRIzol Reagent (Invitro-
gen) according tothemanufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA wassynthesized from
3μgtotal RNA using anoligo-dT25 primer (for SPCFV) orrandom hexamers (for SPCSV)
andMoroCedmvunCerevBemna fnuvS reverse transcriptase RNase H−(Finnzymes) according to
themanufacturer's instructions. The cDNA wasdiluted 10-fold foruseinPCR.
The 30-proximal part oftheSPCFV genome (1578 ntaccording toAY461421), including
theCP- and NaBP-coding regions and the30-UTR [67], wasPCR-amplified using primers
designed inthisstudy (forward primer CFVF: 50-GTCTTTAGR(A/G)TTK(G/T) TR(A/G)
AGAY(T/C)TTA-30;reverse primer CFVR: 50-GCTCAAAAGTACTTTAAAAC- 30).These
primers were complementary tont7527±7547 and 9085±9104 inthetriple gene block 3
(TGB3) protein-coding sequence and 30-UTR genomic region ofSPCFV (AY461421), re-
spectively. ForSPCSV, the30genomic region ofRNA1 wasamplified using forward primer
CSVR3-F2 (50-GTGTTTCATACATTGTTTGTGT GCT-30)and reverse primer CSVp22-R2
(50-AGGTGTATGACTCTAGGG TATAAAC-30)[24]. The PCR mixture and cycling parameters
were those recommended forPhusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes).
PCR products were purified using acombination ofexonuclease I(ExoI) and calfintestinal
alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (Fermentas) asrecommended bythemanufacturer. ExoI
degrades excess primers (ssDNA) and CIAP degrades unincorporated dNTPs, both ofwhich
may inhibit thedideoxy PCR sequencing reaction [150]. Purified products from twoindepen-
dent PCRs were sequenced directly inboth directions using theBigDye Terminator kitver-
sion 3.1(Applied Biosystems) onanABI automatic 3130 XLGenetic Analyzer. The sequences
obtained were compared byBLAST search with existing sequences available intheNational
Center forBiotechnology Information (NCBI) database.
Multiple sequence alignments andfitting ofnucleotide substitution
models
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX version 1.83 [151], examined visually
and translated into amino acid sequences using theEMBOSS web translation tool (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/transe q/index.html). Percent nucleotide and amino acid identities
between sequences were computed using theCLUSTALW procedure [152] asimplemented in
theMEGALIGN program oftheDNASTAR software package.
AMLmethod implemented inMEGA6 [153] wasused tofind thebest nucleotide substitu-
tion model explaining themode ofevolution. Models with thelowest Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) scores were considered tobest describe thesubstitution pattern.

Tests forrecombination andphylogenetic relationships between SPCFV
isolates
The presence ofrecombination inthesequence data wastested using thepairwise homoplasy
index test[154] asimplemented inSplitsTree4 version V4.14.2 [155]. Parent-like sequences
and approximation ofrecombination breakpoints were assessed using theRDP, GENECONV,
BOOTSCAN, MAXIMUM CHI SQUARE, CHIMAERA and SISTER SCAN methods as
implemented intheRecombination Detection Program (RDP4) package [156].
Aphylogenetic tree based onCPsequences was constructed using theneighbor joining
method [157] and theTamura three-parameter nucleotide substitution model (T92) [69]
with invariant sites and gamma distribution ofrates across sites (T92+G+I). Initially, the
general time-reversible (GTR) models [158] with invariant sites and gamma distribution of
rates across sites (GTR+G+I) orwith variable sites (GTR+G) were themost appropriate
models fornucleotide substitution fortheCPdata. However, because ofproblems associ-
ated with implementing theGTR model [159, 160], theT92 model with invariant sites and
gamma distribution ofrates across sites (T92+G+I) was thus used fortheCP,because itpro-
vided thenext lowest BIC score. Forconstruction ofphylogenetic tree based onNaBP
sequences, T92 with gamma distribution across sites (T92+G) was used. Both substitution
models were deduced bymodel fitting (above), which allowed modeling ofevolutionary
rate differences among sites. Abootstrapped consensus tree was inferred from 1000 repli-
cates foreach oftheabove data sets forCPand NaBP. Allphylogenetic analyses were imple-
mented using MEGA6 [153].
Nucleotide diversities andpopulation differentiation inSPCFV
Population genetics parameters with respect totheaverage number ofnucleotide differences
between tworandom sequences inapopulation (ornucleotide diversity index,π)and theaver-
agenumber ofnucleotide substitutions pernon-synonymous (πa)and synonymous (πs)sites
were computed. Synonymous codon usage bias wasmeasured byquantifying thecodon bias
index (CBI) [161] and theeffective number ofcodons (ENC) [162] used inagene.
The extent ofgenetic differentiation orlevel ofgene flow between subpopulations waseval-
uated byestimating RST.RSTmeasures thedegree ofgenetic differentiation between twoputa-
tivesubpopulations bycomparing theagreement between twohaplotypes drawn atrandom
from each subpopulation with theagreement obtained when thehaplotypes aretaken from the
same subpopulation. RSTranges from 0to1forundifferentiated tofully differentiated popula-
tions, respectively. Population genetics parameters and gene flow estimates were calculated
using DnaSP version 5[163].
Analysis ofselection pressure onCPandNaBP
The ratio ofnon-synonymous (gN)tosynonymous (gS)nucleotide substitution rates (ω=
gN/gS)provides asensitive measure ofselective constraints attheprotein level. Values of
ω<1,ω=1andω>1indicate purifying (ornegative) selection, neutral evolution and diver-
sifying (orpositive) selection, respectively. Based onthis, thedirection and intensity ofselec-
tion pressure onafunctional protein canbepredicted [70, 164]. The maximum likelihood
(ML) approach wasapplied totheCP(38sequences) and NaBP (32sequences) used inphylo-
genetic analysis ofSPCFV using seven sitemodels ofcodon evolution implemented inthe
CODEML program ofthePAML package (version 4.7) [165]. The models used include M0
(one-ratio), M1a (nearly neutral), M2a (positive selection), M3(discrete), M7(beta), M8(beta
&ω)and M8a (beta &ω=1)asdescribed [104, 166, 167]. The probability ofobserving data

wascomputed astheloglikelihood, which isthesum ofprobabilities over allcodons inthe
sequence. Selection pressure wasexamined byassessing thevalueωand comparing thelog
likelihoods ofnested models (M0 versus M3, M1a versus M2a, M7versus M8and M8vs.M8a)
inlikelihood ratio tests (LRTs) asdescribed [166, 168]. Where LRTs were significant, aBayes
empirical Bayes inference [167] wasused toidentify theamino acid(s) under positive
selection.
