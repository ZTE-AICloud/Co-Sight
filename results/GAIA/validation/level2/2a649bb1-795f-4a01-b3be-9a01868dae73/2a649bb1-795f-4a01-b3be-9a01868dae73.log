Only limited information is available on wild species able to host economically important viruses that infect sweetpotatoes (Ipomoea batatas). In this study, Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV; Carlavirus, Betaflexiviridae) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; Crinivirus, Closteroviridae) were surveyed in wild plants of family Convolvulaceae (genera Astripomoea, Ipomoea, Hewittia and Lepistemon) in Uganda. Plants belonging to 26 wild species, including annuals, biannuals and perennials from four agro-ecological zones, were observed for virus-like symptoms in 2004 and 2007 and sampled for virus testing. SPCFV was detected in 84 (2.9%) of 2864 plants tested from 17 species. SPCSV was detected in 66 (5.4%) of the 1224 plants from 12 species sampled in 2007. Some SPCSV-infected plants were also infected with Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV; Potyvirus, Potyviridae; 1.3%), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV; Ipomovirus, Potyviridae; 0.5%) or both (0.4%), but none of these three viruses were detected in SPCFV-infected plants. Co-infection of SPFMV with SPMMV was detected in 1.2% of plants sampled. Virus-like symptoms were observed in 367 wild plants (12.8%), of which 42 plants (11.4%) were negative for the viruses tested. Almost all (92.4%) the 419 sweetpotato plants sampled from fields close to the tested wild plants displayed virus-like symptoms, and 87.1% were infected with one or more of the four viruses. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of the 3'-proximal genomic region of SPCFV, including the silencing suppressor (NaBP)- and coat protein (CP)-coding regions implicated strong purifying selection on the CP and NaBP, and that the SPCFV strains from East Africa are distinguishable from those from other continents. However, the strains from wild species and sweetpotato were indistinguishable, suggesting reciprocal movement of SPCFV between wild and cultivated Convolvulaceae plants in the field.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tugume</LastName><ForeName>Arthur K</ForeName><Initials>AK</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Agricultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Plant Sciences, Microbiology and Biotechnology, School of Biosciences, College of Natural Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mukasa</LastName><ForeName>Settumba B</ForeName><Initials>SB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Agricultural Production, School of Agricultural Sciences, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Valkonen</LastName><ForeName>Jari P T</ForeName><Initials>JP</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Agricultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2016</Year><Month>12</Month><Day>22</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>PLoS One</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101285081</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1932-6203</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><ChemicalList><Chemical><RegistryNumber>0</RegistryNumber><NameOfSubs

Progress: 2/8 steps completed (25.0%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 6 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the meaning of SPFMV and SPCSV abbreviations
   Notes: Successfully identified the meaning of the abbreviations:
- SPFMV: Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus
- SPCSV: Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus

These are common viruses affecting sweet potatoes in Africa. We also found that "Pearl of Africa" refers to Uganda, which will help us locate the specific 2016 paper in the next step.

Additionally, we identified common chemicals used in plant virus testing with their EC numbers:
1. Reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49)
2. DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7)
3. RNase H (EC 3.1.26.4)
4. DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1)
5. Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64)

These will be useful when we need to identify the specific chemicals used in the paper.

Plan: Find EC numbers of chemicals for virus testing in 2016 Pearl of Africa paper on SPFMV and SPCSV
======================================================================================================

Progress: 3/7 steps completed (42.9%)
Status: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 1 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the meaning of SPFMV and SPCSV abbreviations
   Notes: Successfully identified the meaning of the abbreviations:
- SPFMV: Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus
- SPCSV: Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus

These are common viruses affecting sweet potatoes in Africa. We also found that "Pearl of Africa" refers to Uganda, which will help us locate the specific 2016 paper in the next step.

Additionally, we identified common chemicals used in plant virus testing with their EC numbers:
1. Reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49)
2. DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7)
3. RNase H (EC 3.1.26.4)
4. DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1)
5. Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64)

These will be useful when we need to identify the specific chemicals used in the paper.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Search for the 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Pearl of Africa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully identified and downloaded the relevant 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda (Pearl of Africa):

Title: "Mixed Infections of Four Viruses, the Incidence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Sweet Potato Chlorotic Fleck Virus (Betaflexiviridae) Isolates in Wild Species and Sweetpotatoes in Uganda and Evidence of Distinct Isolates in East Africa"
Authors: Arthur K. Tugume, Settumba B. Mukasa, Jari P. T. Valkonen
Publication: PLOS ONE, 2016
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0167769

The paper discusses Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus (SPFMV) and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus (SPCSV) in Uganda, which matches our search criteria. I've downloaded the full PDF to F:2a649bb1-795f-4a01-b3be-9a01868dae73/paper.pdf for further analysis of the methods section to identify the chemicals used for virus testing and their EC numbers.
Details: 
Step2 :[!] Locate the methods section focusing on virus testing (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've thoroughly examined the paper "Mixed Infections of Four Viruses, the Incidence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Sweet Potato Chlorotic Fleck Virus (Betaflexiviridae) Isolates in Wild Species and Sweetpotatoes in Uganda and Evidence of Distinct Isolates in East Africa" (2016). 

The paper discusses virus testing methods including RT-PCR for detection of SPFMV and SPCSV in wild plants in Uganda. However, I'm unable to locate the specific EC numbers of the chemicals used for virus testing in this paper. The methods section mentions using "Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H?(Finnzymes)" and "Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes)" for the molecular detection, but doesn't provide their EC numbers.

The paper focuses on the incidence and phylogenetic relationships of these viruses rather than providing detailed enzyme specifications with EC numbers. To proceed, we would need to find additional information about the standard EC numbers for reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase commonly used in virus testing methods for SPFMV and SPCSV.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've analyzed the 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda (Pearl of Africa) to identify the two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing. After downloading and examining the full paper, I found that the methods section mentions two specific enzymes used for virus testing:

1. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H- (Finnzymes) - This enzyme is used for reverse transcription in the RT-PCR detection method. The EC number for reverse transcriptase is 2.7.7.49.

2. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) - This enzyme is used for PCR amplification in the molecular detection methods. The EC number for DNA polymerase is 2.7.7.7.

These two enzymes were the primary chemicals used for virus testing in the paper, specifically for detecting SPFMV and SPCSV in wild plants and sweetpotatoes in Uganda. The paper mentions these enzymes on page 17 in the "Molecular detection of SPCFV and SPCSV" section of the Materials and Methods.

The paper doesn't explicitly list the EC numbers, but these are the standard EC numbers for these enzyme types according to enzyme classification databases.
Details: 
Step4 :[ ] Find the EC numbers of these chemicals (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Alphabetize the chemical names (depends on: 3, 4)
Step6 :[ ] Format the answer as semicolon-separated EC numbers in alphabetical order of chemicals (depends on: 5)

Step0 :[?] Identify the meaning of SPFMV and SPCSV abbreviations
   Notes: Successfully identified the meaning of the abbreviations:
- SPFMV: Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus
- SPCSV: Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus

These are common viruses affecting sweet potatoes in Africa. We also found that "Pearl of Africa" refers to Uganda, which will help us locate the specific 2016 paper in the next step.

Additionally, we identified common chemicals used in plant virus testing with their EC numbers:
1. Reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49)
2. DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7)
3. RNase H (EC 3.1.26.4)
4. DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1)
5. Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64)

These will be useful when we need to identify the specific chemicals used in the paper.

Title: "Mixed Infections of Four Viruses, the Incidence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Sweet Potato Chlorotic Fleck Virus (Betaflexiviridae) Isolates in Wild Species and Sweetpotatoes in Uganda and Evidence of Distinct Isolates in East Africa"
Authors: Arthur K. Tugume, Settumba B. Mukasa, Jari P. T. Valkonen
Publication: PLOS ONE, 2016
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0167769

The paper discusses Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus (SPFMV) and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus (SPCSV) in Uganda, which matches our search criteria. I've downloaded the full PDF to F:2a649bb1-795f-4a01-b3be-9a01868dae73/paper.pdf for further analysis of the methods section to identify the chemicals used for virus testing and their EC numbers.
Step2 :[!] Locate the methods section focusing on virus testing (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've thoroughly examined the paper "Mixed Infections of Four Viruses, the Incidence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Sweet Potato Chlorotic Fleck Virus (Betaflexiviridae) Isolates in Wild Species and Sweetpotatoes in Uganda and Evidence of Distinct Isolates in East Africa" (2016). 

The paper discusses virus testing methods including RT-PCR for detection of SPFMV and SPCSV in wild plants in Uganda. However, I'm unable to locate the specific EC numbers of the chemicals used for virus testing in this paper. The methods section mentions using "Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H?(Finnzymes)" and "Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes)" for the molecular detection, but doesn't provide their EC numbers.

The paper focuses on the incidence and phylogenetic relationships of these viruses rather than providing detailed enzyme specifications with EC numbers. To proceed, we would need to find additional information about the standard EC numbers for reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase commonly used in virus testing methods for SPFMV and SPCSV.
Step3 :[?] Identify the two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've analyzed the 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda (Pearl of Africa) to identify the two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing. After downloading and examining the full paper, I found that the methods section mentions two specific enzymes used for virus testing:

1. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H- (Finnzymes) - This enzyme is used for reverse transcription in the RT-PCR detection method. The EC number for reverse transcriptase is 2.7.7.49.

2. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) - This enzyme is used for PCR amplification in the molecular detection methods. The EC number for DNA polymerase is 2.7.7.7.

These two enzymes were the primary chemicals used for virus testing in the paper, specifically for detecting SPFMV and SPCSV in wild plants and sweetpotatoes in Uganda. The paper mentions these enzymes on page 17 in the "Molecular detection of SPCFV and SPCSV" section of the Materials and Methods.

The paper doesn't explicitly list the EC numbers, but these are the standard EC numbers for these enzyme types according to enzyme classification databases.
Step4 :[ ] Alphabetize the chemical names (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Format the answer as semicolon-separated EC numbers in alphabetical order of chemicals (depends on: 4)

Plan: Find EC numbers of chemicals for virus testing in 2016 Pearl of Africa paper on SPFMV and SPCSV
======================================================================================================

Progress: 4/6 steps completed (66.7%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 1 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the meaning of SPFMV and SPCSV abbreviations
   Notes: Successfully identified the meaning of the abbreviations:
- SPFMV: Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus
- SPCSV: Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus

These are common viruses affecting sweet potatoes in Africa. We also found that "Pearl of Africa" refers to Uganda, which will help us locate the specific 2016 paper in the next step.

Additionally, we identified common chemicals used in plant virus testing with their EC numbers:
1. Reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49)
2. DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7)
3. RNase H (EC 3.1.26.4)
4. DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1)
5. Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64)

These will be useful when we need to identify the specific chemicals used in the paper.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Search for the 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Pearl of Africa (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully identified and downloaded the relevant 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda (Pearl of Africa):

Title: "Mixed Infections of Four Viruses, the Incidence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Sweet Potato Chlorotic Fleck Virus (Betaflexiviridae) Isolates in Wild Species and Sweetpotatoes in Uganda and Evidence of Distinct Isolates in East Africa"
Authors: Arthur K. Tugume, Settumba B. Mukasa, Jari P. T. Valkonen
Publication: PLOS ONE, 2016
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0167769

The paper discusses Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus (SPFMV) and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus (SPCSV) in Uganda, which matches our search criteria. I've downloaded the full PDF to F:2a649bb1-795f-4a01-b3be-9a01868dae73/paper.pdf for further analysis of the methods section to identify the chemicals used for virus testing and their EC numbers.
Details: 
Step2 :[!] Locate the methods section focusing on virus testing (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I've thoroughly examined the paper "Mixed Infections of Four Viruses, the Incidence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Sweet Potato Chlorotic Fleck Virus (Betaflexiviridae) Isolates in Wild Species and Sweetpotatoes in Uganda and Evidence of Distinct Isolates in East Africa" (2016). 

The paper discusses virus testing methods including RT-PCR for detection of SPFMV and SPCSV in wild plants in Uganda. However, I'm unable to locate the specific EC numbers of the chemicals used for virus testing in this paper. The methods section mentions using "Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H?(Finnzymes)" and "Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes)" for the molecular detection, but doesn't provide their EC numbers.

The paper focuses on the incidence and phylogenetic relationships of these viruses rather than providing detailed enzyme specifications with EC numbers. To proceed, we would need to find additional information about the standard EC numbers for reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase commonly used in virus testing methods for SPFMV and SPCSV.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Identify the two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've analyzed the 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda (Pearl of Africa) to identify the two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing. After downloading and examining the full paper, I found that the methods section mentions two specific enzymes used for virus testing:

1. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H- (Finnzymes) - This enzyme is used for reverse transcription in the RT-PCR detection method. The EC number for reverse transcriptase is 2.7.7.49.

2. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) - This enzyme is used for PCR amplification in the molecular detection methods. The EC number for DNA polymerase is 2.7.7.7.

These two enzymes were the primary chemicals used for virus testing in the paper, specifically for detecting SPFMV and SPCSV in wild plants and sweetpotatoes in Uganda. The paper mentions these enzymes on page 17 in the "Molecular detection of SPCFV and SPCSV" section of the Materials and Methods.

The paper doesn't explicitly list the EC numbers, but these are the standard EC numbers for these enzyme types according to enzyme classification databases.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Alphabetize the chemical names (depends on: 3)
   Notes: I've successfully alphabetized the chemical names from the 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda (Pearl of Africa). The two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing mentioned in the paper are:

1. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (listed first alphabetically)
2. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (listed second alphabetically)

These enzymes were used for RT-PCR detection of the viruses in the study. The paper clearly mentions these two enzymes in the "Molecular detection of SPCFV and SPCSV" section of the Materials and Methods.
