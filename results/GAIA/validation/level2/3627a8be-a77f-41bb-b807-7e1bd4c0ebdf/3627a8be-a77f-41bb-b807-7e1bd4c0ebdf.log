result of search_wiki: Nassarius, common name nassa mud snails (USA) or dog whelks (UK), is a genus of minute to medium-sized sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Nassariidae. They are scavengers.


== Etymology ==
The name is derived from the Latin word "nassa", meaning a wickerbasket with a narrow neck, for catching fish. Nassarius would then mean "someone who uses such a wickerbasket for catching fish".


== Ecology ==


=== Distribution and habitat ===
Species within this genus are found worldwide.

result of search_wiki: Blombos Cave is an archaeological site located in Blombos Private Nature Reserve, about 300 km east of Cape Town on the Southern Cape coastline, South Africa. The cave contains Middle Stone Age (MSA) deposits currently dated at between c. 100,000 and 70,000 years Before Present (BP), and a Late Stone Age sequence dated at between 2000 and 300 years BP. The cave site was first excavated in 1991 and field work has been conducted there on a regular basis since 1997, and is ongoing.
The excavations at Blombos Cave have yielded important new information on the behavioural evolution of anatomically modern humans. The archaeological record from this cave site has been central in the ongoing debate on the cognitive and cultural origin of early humans and to the current understanding of when and where key behavioural innovations emerged among Homo sapiens in southern Africa during the Late Pleistocene.

All steps completed with results: {1: "Step 1: step_status is blocked, step_notes is I attempted multiple approaches to find information about Nassarius shell beads in the context of the 2021 Science Advances article:\n\n1. Direct Google searches for the museum object and Science Advances article\n2.

Direct web requests to academic journal websites including PNAS and Science Advances\n4. Searching for news articles about the research from sources like Phys.org, ScienceDaily, and HeritageDaily\n\nAll these approaches were unsuccessful due to technical issues:\n- Google search functions returned errors\n- Direct web requests resulted in 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, or other error responses\n- Wikipedia searches found limited information\n- News article requests also failed with various errors\n\nWe need to try a different approach to find information about the 2021 Science Advances article that discusses the age of beads made from Nassarius shells.

Content excerpt: Humans reached the Americas at least 7,000 years earlier than previously thought, according to new findings. The topic of when the continent was first settled from Asia has been controversial for decades. Many researchers are sceptical of evidence for humans in the North American interior much earlier than 16,000 years ago. Now, a team working in New Mexico has found scores of human footprints dated to between 23,000 and 21,000 years old. The discovery could transform views about when the contin...

Plan: Research the age of beads made from mollusk species with British Museum number 2012,5015.17
==================================================================================================

Progress: 1/5 steps completed (20.0%)
Status: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 3 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[!] Try alternative search methods to find information about the 2021 Science Advances article on mollusk shell beads
   Notes: I attempted multiple approaches to find information about the British Museum object 2012,5015.17 and the related 2021 Science Advances article, including:
1. Direct Google searches for the museum object and Science Advances article
2. Wikipedia searches for information about Nassarius shells
3. Direct web requests to the British Museum and Science Advances websites
4. Alternative search approaches using DuckDuckGo and Google Scholar
5. Searching for news articles about the research

All these approaches were unsuccessful due to technical issues:
- Google search functions returned errors
- Direct web requests resulted in 403 Forbidden responses
- Wikipedia searches found no relevant pages

I'm unable to proceed with finding information about the 2021 Science Advances article that discusses the age of beads made from the mollusk species corresponding to British Museum object 2012,5015.17. We need to try a different approach or use different tools to access this information.
Details: 
Step1 :[!] Search specifically for 'Nassarius' shell beads in the context of the 2021 Science Advances article (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I attempted multiple approaches to find information about Nassarius shell beads in the context of the 2021 Science Advances article:

1. Direct Google searches for the museum object and Science Advances article
2. Wikipedia searches for information about Nassarius shells (found basic information but nothing about archaeological significance)
3. Direct web requests to academic journal websites including PNAS and Science Advances
4. Searching for news articles about the research from sources like Phys.org, ScienceDaily, and HeritageDaily

All these approaches were unsuccessful due to technical issues:
- Google search functions returned errors
- Direct web requests resulted in 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, or other error responses
- Wikipedia searches found limited information
- News article requests also failed with various errors

We need to try a different approach to find information about the 2021 Science Advances article that discusses the age of beads made from Nassarius shells. Possible alternatives could include:
1. Trying different search terms or search engines
2. Looking for press releases from research institutions involved in the study
3. Searching for the researchers' names who might have authored the 2021 paper
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Look for news articles or press releases that might summarize the findings of the research article (depends on: 0)

Step3 :[!] Extract information about the age of beads made from mollusk shells (depends on: 1, 2)
   Notes: I attempted multiple approaches to extract information about the age of beads made from Nassarius shells as mentioned in the 2021 Science Advances article:

1. Direct searches for the British Museum object 2012,5015.17
2. Attempts to access the Science Advances article directly
3. Searches for news articles and press releases about the 2021 study
4. Attempts to access related academic papers
5. Searches for information from university press releases

All these approaches were unsuccessful due to technical limitations:
- 403 Forbidden errors when accessing academic journals
- 404 Not Found errors for most news articles
- Connection timeouts and other network errors

Despite trying various URLs, user agents, and request methods, we were unable to access any content that would provide information about the age of the Nassarius shell beads mentioned in the 2021 Science Advances article abstract. This step is blocked as we cannot extract the required information using the current methods and tools available.

   Notes: I attempted multiple approaches to find information about the British Museum object 2012,5015.17 and the related 2021 Science Advances article, including:
1. Direct Google searches for the museum object and Science Advances article
2. Wikipedia searches for information about Nassarius shells
3. Direct web requests to the British Museum and Science Advances websites
4. Alternative search approaches using DuckDuckGo and Google Scholar
5. Searching for news articles about the research

All these approaches were unsuccessful due to technical issues:
- Google search functions returned errors
- Direct web requests resulted in 403 Forbidden responses
- Wikipedia searches found no relevant pages

I'm unable to proceed with finding information about the 2021 Science Advances article that discusses the age of beads made from the mollusk species corresponding to British Museum object 2012,5015.17. We need to try a different approach or use different tools to access this information.

Step1 :[!] Search specifically for 'Nassarius' shell beads in the context of the 2021 Science Advances article (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I attempted multiple approaches to find information about Nassarius shell beads in the context of the 2021 Science Advances article:

1. Direct Google searches for the museum object and Science Advances article
2. Wikipedia searches for information about Nassarius shells (found basic information but nothing about archaeological significance)
3. Direct web requests to academic journal websites including PNAS and Science Advances
4. Searching for news articles about the research from sources like Phys.org, ScienceDaily, and HeritageDaily

All these approaches were unsuccessful due to technical issues:
- Google search functions returned errors
- Direct web requests resulted in 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, or other error responses
- Wikipedia searches found limited information
- News article requests also failed with various errors

We need to try a different approach to find information about the 2021 Science Advances article that discusses the age of beads made from Nassarius shells. Possible alternatives could include:
1. Trying different search terms or search engines
2. Looking for press releases from research institutions involved in the study
3. Searching for the researchers' names who might have authored the 2021 paper
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Look for news articles or press releases that might summarize the findings of the research article (depends on: 0)

Step3 :[!] Extract information about the age of beads made from mollusk shells (depends on: 1, 2)
   Notes: I attempted multiple approaches to extract information about the age of beads made from Nassarius shells as mentioned in the 2021 Science Advances article:

1. Direct searches for the British Museum object 2012,5015.17
2. Attempts to access the Science Advances article directly
3. Searches for news articles and press releases about the 2021 study
4. Attempts to access related academic papers
5. Searches for information from university press releases

All these approaches were unsuccessful due to technical limitations:
- 403 Forbidden errors when accessing academic journals
- 404 Not Found errors for most news articles
- Connection timeouts and other network errors

Despite trying various URLs, user agents, and request methods, we were unable to access any content that would provide information about the age of the Nassarius shell beads mentioned in the 2021 Science Advances article abstract.
