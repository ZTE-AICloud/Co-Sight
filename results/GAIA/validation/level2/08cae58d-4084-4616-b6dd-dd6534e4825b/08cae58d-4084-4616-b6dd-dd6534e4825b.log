A $100 investment in the company’s stock at the beginning of 2002 would have grown to more than 520 times the original investment as of October 2024.\nAll Apple stock price quotes in this article are outright prices, not prices adjusted for dividends and splits. The effect of stock splits is noted and calculated into the total result. But, the impact of dividends, which would slightly enhance the value of the investment, is not reflected.\nKey Takeaways\nOn October 21, 2024, Apple closed at $236.22. Multiplied by 224, an initial investment of $100 would be worth approximately $52,913.28. Apple launched its initial public offering (IPO) on December 12, 1980, selling 46 million shares at $22. The company\'s shares sold out almost immediately; at that point in time, no other company had generated more capital with its public offering since Ford went public in 1956.\nApple\'s Initial Public Offering (IPO)\nApple launched its initial public offering (IPO) on December 12, 1980, selling 46 million shares at $22. The company\'s shares sold out almost immediately; at that point in time, no other company had generated more capital with its public offering since Ford went public in 1956. Because of the large number of shareholders, the company had to hold its first shareholder meeting as a public company at De Anza College\'s Flint Center in Cupertino.\nGradual Ascent to Prominence and Profits\nIt’s easy to view Apple as a monumental success story now. However, the beginning of this investment adventure wouldn\'t have started well.\nThe closing share price quoted for Apple for Jan. 2, 2002, the first trading day of the year, was $23.30. Rounding to the nearest whole share, a $100 investment would have secured four shares of Apple\'s stock.\nBut, by the end of 2002, the stock price declined to $14.33 a share. In terms of the hypothetical $100 investment in this article, this would have represented an approximately\xa040% loss. However, the next couple of years were lucrative for Apple investors; the company continued to grow in the marketplace—as a result of more advanced versions of its popular iPod and the opening of the iTunes store in 2003. By the end of 2004, Apple’s stock price climbed to $64.40 per share, making an original investment of $100 now worth $257.60.\nA Stock Split and Continuing Climb\nIn February 2005, Apple initiated a two-for-one stock split , which would have transformed the original investment into a total of eight shares. In 2006, Apple debuted the MacBook Pro, the second Apple desktop computer product that used Intel’s core duo processor. In 2007, it followed up with the launch of the iPhone, which revolutionized the cell phone industry. The iPhone 3G followed in 2008, and in 2010, the iPhone 4 was introduced, along with another soon-to-be wildly successful product, the iPad.\nThe stock\'s closing price at the end of 2005 was $71.89, making the total value of the investment $575.12. Two years later, the 2007 closing price was $198.08, making the hypothetical investment worth $1,584.64. The stock suffered approximately a 50% downside retracement in 2008, closing out the year at $85.35 a share.\nHowever, in 2009 Apple stock resumed its long-term uptrend and closed out 2010 at $46.08 a share—which, multiplied by eight shares, equals $368.64. It may have been tempting for an investor to sell at that point, having more than tripled their original investment. But, that would have been a short-sighted mistake, as there was more good fortune in store for Apple shareholders.\nAnother Split and a Steeper Uptrend\nApple’s status as a leading firm in the technology sector has only enhanced and solidified in the past decades, as the company regularly introduced new and improved versions of the iPhone and the iPad—and unveiled the Apple Watch.\nApple stock began a steep uptrend between mid-2010 and 2015. During this period, the stock only suffered one major downside correction—which extended from late 2012 through mid-2013, when stock price retraced from $100.01 on September 17, 2012—then down to $56.65 a share on June 24, 2013. Following that corrective retracement, the stock resumed an even sharper uptrend, one that lasted into the first half of 2015.\nIn June 2014, Apple did a seven-for-one stock split. At that time, eight shares would have become 56, which sold for $93.70 per share immediately following the split. That would make the original, hypothetical investment worth $5,247.20. When the stock price hit its 2015 high closing price of $133 a share, 56 shares were worth $7,448. Subsequent price action saw\xa0Apple stock in another downside correction.\nOn October 16, 2019, Apple closed at $235.67. Multiplied by 56 shares, the total value would have been $13,197.52. In August 2020, Apple did a four-for-one stock split. At that time, 56 shares would have become 224 shares.\nOn October 21, 2024, Apple closed at $236.22. Multiplied by 224, the initial investment would be worth $52,913.28.\nHow Does Apple Stock Look Now?\nGoing forward, Apple is still a leading technology firm . In all likelihood, it will continue to outperform in the sector. As of November 30, 2024, Apple has a market capitalization value of $3.55 trillion. Apple\'s market capitalization hit $1 trillion on August 2, 2018—the first publicly traded company to ever reach that mark. The company\'s share prices rose as high as $233.47 after reaching that milestone. Apple has a\xa0 price/earnings ratio \xa0(P/E) of 39.03. Apple’s return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) figures are also substantially above average.\nHow to Take a Bite Out of the Apple\nBecause Apple stock comes at such a premium, it may not be feasible for all retail investors to buy shares in the company outright. But, that doesn\'t mean you can\'t take part in the action. After all, it\'s one of the most recognized brands in the world.\nConsider investing in a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a position in Apple. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs don\'t require a minimum investment, and many ETFs are commission and/or fee-free. But, if you\'re set on buying actual shares in the company, consider setting a minimum aside in your brokerage account and buying fractional shares. You can buy a little at a time until you secure a full set of shares.\nDoes Apple (AAPL) Pay a Dividend?\nYes, Apple has paid a quarterly dividend since 2012. As of the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024, it was paying a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend.\nIs Apple One of the Most Profitable Companies?\nYes, Apple is considered one of the most profitable companies in the world. Apple is often included in lists of the most profitable companies in the world based on annual profits, alongside other technology giants, including Alphabet and Microsoft.\nWhat Makes Apple So Valuable?\nApple\'s record revenue and profits are a result of its products and services, including its phones, watches, laptops, tablets, a streaming service, and more. All of these products resonate with consumers. In addition, the brand\'s products have reshaped the advertising and social media industries.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile it would have been wonderful to acquire Apple stock for just a little over $20 a share in hindsight, that doesn’t mean the stock isn’t also worth buying now, at over $200 a share. Apple’s financials look strong across the board, and the company has more than established its ability to introduce quality products and win in the marketplace.\xa0Therefore, investors may do well to consider buying Apple for future returns on investment.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

A $100 investment in the company’s stock at the beginning of 2002 would have grown to more than 520 times the original investment as of October 2024.\nAll Apple stock price quotes in this article are outright prices, not prices adjusted for dividends and splits. The effect of stock splits is noted and calculated into the total result. But, the impact of dividends, which would slightly enhance the value of the investment, is not reflected.\nKey Takeaways\nOn October 21, 2024, Apple closed at $236.22. Multiplied by 224, an initial investment of $100 would be worth approximately $52,913.28. Apple launched its initial public offering (IPO) on December 12, 1980, selling 46 million shares at $22. The company\'s shares sold out almost immediately; at that point in time, no other company had generated more capital with its public offering since Ford went public in 1956.\nApple\'s Initial Public Offering (IPO)\nApple launched its initial public offering (IPO) on December 12, 1980, selling 46 million shares at $22. The company\'s shares sold out almost immediately; at that point in time, no other company had generated more capital with its public offering since Ford went public in 1956. Because of the large number of shareholders, the company had to hold its first shareholder meeting as a public company at De Anza College\'s Flint Center in Cupertino.\nGradual Ascent to Prominence and Profits\nIt’s easy to view Apple as a monumental success story now. However, the beginning of this investment adventure wouldn\'t have started well.\nThe closing share price quoted for Apple for Jan. 2, 2002, the first trading day of the year, was $23.30. Rounding to the nearest whole share, a $100 investment would have secured four shares of Apple\'s stock.\nBut, by the end of 2002, the stock price declined to $14.33 a share. In terms of the hypothetical $100 investment in this article, this would have represented an approximately\xa040% loss. However, the next couple of years were lucrative for Apple investors; the company continued to grow in the marketplace—as a result of more advanced versions of its popular iPod and the opening of the iTunes store in 2003. By the end of 2004, Apple’s stock price climbed to $64.40 per share, making an original investment of $100 now worth $257.60.\nA Stock Split and Continuing Climb\nIn February 2005, Apple initiated a two-for-one stock split , which would have transformed the original investment into a total of eight shares. In 2006, Apple debuted the MacBook Pro, the second Apple desktop computer product that used Intel’s core duo processor. In 2007, it followed up with the launch of the iPhone, which revolutionized the cell phone industry. The iPhone 3G followed in 2008, and in 2010, the iPhone 4 was introduced, along with another soon-to-be wildly successful product, the iPad.\nThe stock\'s closing price at the end of 2005 was $71.89, making the total value of the investment $575.12. Two years later, the 2007 closing price was $198.08, making the hypothetical investment worth $1,584.64. The stock suffered approximately a 50% downside retracement in 2008, closing out the year at $85.35 a share.\nHowever, in 2009 Apple stock resumed its long-term uptrend and closed out 2010 at $46.08 a share—which, multiplied by eight shares, equals $368.64. It may have been tempting for an investor to sell at that point, having more than tripled their original investment. But, that would have been a short-sighted mistake, as there was more good fortune in store for Apple shareholders.\nAnother Split and a Steeper Uptrend\nApple’s status as a leading firm in the technology sector has only enhanced and solidified in the past decades, as the company regularly introduced new and improved versions of the iPhone and the iPad—and unveiled the Apple Watch.\nApple stock began a steep uptrend between mid-2010 and 2015. During this period, the stock only suffered one major downside correction—which extended from late 2012 through mid-2013, when stock price retraced from $100.01 on September 17, 2012—then down to $56.65 a share on June 24, 2013. Following that corrective retracement, the stock resumed an even sharper uptrend, one that lasted into the first half of 2015.\nIn June 2014, Apple did a seven-for-one stock split. At that time, eight shares would have become 56, which sold for $93.70 per share immediately following the split. That would make the original, hypothetical investment worth $5,247.20. When the stock price hit its 2015 high closing price of $133 a share, 56 shares were worth $7,448. Subsequent price action saw\xa0Apple stock in another downside correction.\nOn October 16, 2019, Apple closed at $235.67. Multiplied by 56 shares, the total value would have been $13,197.52. In August 2020, Apple did a four-for-one stock split. At that time, 56 shares would have become 224 shares.\nOn October 21, 2024, Apple closed at $236.22. Multiplied by 224, the initial investment would be worth $52,913.28.\nHow Does Apple Stock Look Now?\nGoing forward, Apple is still a leading technology firm . In all likelihood, it will continue to outperform in the sector. As of November 30, 2024, Apple has a market capitalization value of $3.55 trillion. Apple\'s market capitalization hit $1 trillion on August 2, 2018—the first publicly traded company to ever reach that mark. The company\'s share prices rose as high as $233.47 after reaching that milestone. Apple has a\xa0 price/earnings ratio \xa0(P/E) of 39.03. Apple’s return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) figures are also substantially above average.\nHow to Take a Bite Out of the Apple\nBecause Apple stock comes at such a premium, it may not be feasible for all retail investors to buy shares in the company outright. But, that doesn\'t mean you can\'t take part in the action. After all, it\'s one of the most recognized brands in the world.\nConsider investing in a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a position in Apple. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs don\'t require a minimum investment, and many ETFs are commission and/or fee-free. But, if you\'re set on buying actual shares in the company, consider setting a minimum aside in your brokerage account and buying fractional shares. You can buy a little at a time until you secure a full set of shares.\nDoes Apple (AAPL) Pay a Dividend?\nYes, Apple has paid a quarterly dividend since 2012. As of the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024, it was paying a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend.\nIs Apple One of the Most Profitable Companies?\nYes, Apple is considered one of the most profitable companies in the world. Apple is often included in lists of the most profitable companies in the world based on annual profits, alongside other technology giants, including Alphabet and Microsoft.\nWhat Makes Apple So Valuable?\nApple\'s record revenue and profits are a result of its products and services, including its phones, watches, laptops, tablets, a streaming service, and more. All of these products resonate with consumers. In addition, the brand\'s products have reshaped the advertising and social media industries.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile it would have been wonderful to acquire Apple stock for just a little over $20 a share in hindsight, that doesn’t mean the stock isn’t also worth buying now, at over $200 a share. Apple’s financials look strong across the board, and the company has more than established its ability to introduce quality products and win in the marketplace.\xa0Therefore, investors may do well to consider buying Apple for future returns on investment.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
