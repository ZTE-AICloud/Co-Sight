Plan: Research on Clownfish (Finding Nemo Fish) as Invasive Species
====================================================================

Progress: 2/6 steps completed (33.3%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 4 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the fish species that was the main character in Finding Nemo (clownfish/Amphiprion species)
   Notes: I have identified the fish species that was the main character in Finding Nemo. It is the Ocellaris clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris), also known as the false percula clownfish or common clownfish. This is the orange fish with white stripes that was portrayed as Nemo in the movie. This species belongs to the genus Amphiprion and is a marine fish that naturally lives in the Indo-Pacific Ocean in tropical marine habitats associated with rocky or coral reefs. This information will be used in the next steps to research where this species has been found as a nonnative species according to USGS records.

Plan: Research on Clownfish (Finding Nemo Fish) as Invasive Species
====================================================================

Progress: 2/3 steps completed (66.7%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the fish species that was the main character in Finding Nemo (clownfish/Amphiprion species)
   Notes: I have identified the fish species that was the main character in Finding Nemo. It is the Ocellaris clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris), also known as the false percula clownfish or common clownfish. This is the orange fish with white stripes that was portrayed as Nemo in the movie. This species belongs to the genus Amphiprion and is a marine fish that naturally lives in the Indo-Pacific Ocean in tropical marine habitats associated with rocky or coral reefs. This information will be used in the next steps to research where this species has been found as a nonnative species according to USGS records.
Step1 :[?] Research USGS databases for records of clownfish as a nonnative species before 2020 (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I researched the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database for records of clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) as a nonnative species before 2020. The database shows only one occurrence: a single clownfish was collected in July 2018 at Fred Howard Park in Pinellas County, Florida. Fred Howard Park is located at 1700 Sunset Dr, Tarpon Springs, FL with the zip code 34689. No other occurrences of this species as nonnative were recorded in the USGS database before 2020. This information will be used in the next steps to format the answer as requested.
Step2 :[ ] Format the answer as the 5-digit zip code where the clownfish was found (depends on: 1)
