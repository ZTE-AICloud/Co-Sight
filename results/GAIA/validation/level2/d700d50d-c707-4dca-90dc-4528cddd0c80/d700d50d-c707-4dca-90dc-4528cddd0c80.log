result of search_wiki: Roger Dean Miller Sr. (January 2, 1936 – October 25, 1992) was an American singer-songwriter, widely known for his honky-tonk-influenced novelty songs and his chart-topping country hits "King of the Road", "Dang Me", and "England Swings".
After growing up in Oklahoma and serving in the U.S. Army, Miller began his musical career as a songwriter in the late 1950s, writing such hits as "Billy Bayou" and "Home" for Jim Reeves and "Invitation to the Blues" for Ray Price. He later began a recording career and reached the peak of his fame in the mid-1960s, continuing to record and tour into the 1990s, charting his final top 20 country hit "Old Friends" with Price and Willie Nelson in 1982. He also wrote and performed several of the songs for the 1973 Disney animated film Robin Hood.

   Notes: I've identified that the song performed by both a rooster and a hamster in separate animated videos is "Whistle Stop," which was composed by Roger Miller for Disney's 1973 animated film "Robin Hood." In the original film, the song is performed by a rooster character named Alan-a-Dale (voiced by Roger Miller himself). The same song was later adapted into "The Hampsterdance Song," which used a sped-up sample of "Whistle Stop" with different lyrics and tempo, featuring animated hamsters. This confirms that Roger Miller is the composer of the original song that appeared in both animated videos.
Step1 :[?] Research animated videos featuring hamsters performing songs
   Notes: I've completed research on animated videos featuring hamsters performing songs. The key findings are:

1. The famous "Hamster Dance" viral internet phenomenon was based on a sped-up sample of "Whistle-Stop"
2. "Whistle-Stop" was originally composed by Roger Miller for the 1973 Disney film Robin Hood
3. The Hamster Dance version had different tempo and lyrics compared to the original
4. The connection between the hamster and rooster versions is that the same song ("Whistle-Stop") was performed by:
   - A rooster character (Allan-a-Dale) in the original Disney film Robin Hood
   - Hamsters in the later viral "Hamster Dance" video/song

This research confirms that Roger Miller is the composer who created the song that was performed by both a rooster and hamsters in separate animated videos at different tempos with different lyrics.
Step2 :[?] Identify potential matches where the same song appears in both types of videos (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: I've successfully identified that the song that appears in both rooster and hamster animated videos is "Whistle Stop." This song was originally composed by Roger Miller for Disney's 1973 animated film "Robin Hood" where it was performed by a rooster character. The same melody was later used as the basis for "The Hampsterdance Song" by Hampton the Hampster, which was a novelty song released in 2000 that featured animated hamsters. The hamster version used a sped-up sample of the original song with different lyrics. Multiple sources confirm Roger Miller as the composer of the original song, including Wikipedia and music platforms. This match satisfies our criteria of the same song appearing in both rooster and hamster animated videos.
