result of search_wiki: The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the gurry shark or grey shark, is a large shark of the family Somniosidae ("sleeper sharks"), closely related to the Pacific and southern sleeper sharks. Inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, they are notable for their exceptional longevity, although they are poorly studied due to the depth and remoteness of their natural habitat.
Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate, estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. They are among the largest extant shark species, reaching a maximum confirmed length of 6.4 m (21 ft) long and weighing over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). They reach sexual maturity at about 150 years of age, and their pups are born alive after an estimated gestation period of 8 to 18 years.

result of search_wiki: Greenland is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. It is by far the largest geographically of three constituent parts of the kingdom; the other two are metropolitan Denmark and the Faroe Islands. Citizens of Greenland are full citizens of Denmark and of the European Union. Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union and is part of the Council of Europe. It is the world's largest island, and lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

Multiple sources confirm that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate, estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. This information was found through scientific research articles and reliable sources like BBC News and Wikipedia. The Greenland shark is named after Greenland, which is the island we need to find the population for in subsequent steps.
Details: 
Step1 :[ ] Determine which island this vertebrate is named after (depends on: 0)
Step2 :[ ] Locate the Wikipedia page for the identified island (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Find the 2020 population estimate on the Wikipedia page (as it appeared on January 1, 2021) (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Verify the data is from a reliable section of the Wikipedia article (depends on: 2, 3)
Step5 :[ ] Round the population figure to the nearest thousand (depends on: 3, 4)
Step6 :[ ] Formulate the final answer with proper citation (depends on: 4, 5)

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the longest-lived vertebrate species through scientific research
   Notes: Successfully identified the Greenland shark as the longest-lived vertebrate species. Multiple sources confirm that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate, estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. This information was found through scientific research articles and reliable sources like BBC News and Wikipedia. The Greenland shark is named after Greenland, which is the island we need to find the population for in subsequent steps.

===========================================================================================================

Progress: 2/6 steps completed (33.3%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 4 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the longest-lived vertebrate species through scientific research
   Notes: Successfully identified the Greenland shark as the longest-lived vertebrate species. Multiple sources confirm that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate, estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. This information was found through scientific research articles and reliable sources like BBC News and Wikipedia. The Greenland shark is named after Greenland, which is the island we need to find the population for in subsequent steps.
Step1 :[?] Determine which island this vertebrate is named after (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully confirmed that the longest-lived vertebrate, the Greenland shark, is named after Greenland. Greenland is confirmed to be an island - in fact, it's the world's largest island. Multiple sources, including BBC News, Wikipedia, and The New Yorker, confirm that the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate known on Earth, with an estimated lifespan between 250 and 500 years.
Step2 :[ ] Locate the Wikipedia page for Greenland and find the 2020 population estimate (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Verify the data is from a reliable section of the Wikipedia article (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Round the population figure to the nearest thousand (depends on: 2, 3)
Step5 :[ ] Formulate the final answer with proper citation (depends on: 3, 4)

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the longest-lived vertebrate species through scientific research
   Notes: Successfully identified the Greenland shark as the longest-lived vertebrate species. Multiple sources confirm that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate, estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. This information was found through scientific research articles and reliable sources like BBC News and Wikipedia. The Greenland shark is named after Greenland, which is the island we need to find the population for in subsequent steps.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Determine which island this vertebrate is named after (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully confirmed that the longest-lived vertebrate, the Greenland shark, is named after Greenland. Greenland is confirmed to be an island - in fact, it's the world's largest island. Multiple sources, including BBC News, Wikipedia, and The New Yorker, confirm that the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate known on Earth, with an estimated lifespan between 250 and 500 years.
