Steps:
Step0 :[?] Search for the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372 using academic databases and search engines
   Notes: I successfully found and accessed the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372. The book is "A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt" by Herman Westerink, published by Leuven University Press in 2013. I was able to download and extract the content of Chapter 2, which is titled "Dark Traces".
Step1 :[?] Identify that the book is about Sigmund Freud (the neurologist in question) (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Based on the information already gathered in Step 0, I can confirm that the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372 is "A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt" by Herman Westerink. The book is indeed about Sigmund Freud, who was a renowned neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis. This confirms that Freud is the neurologist mentioned in the question.
Step2 :[?] Read through Chapter 2 of the book to locate mentions of 'endopsychic myths' (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: I successfully read through Chapter 2 of "A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt" and located the mentions of 'endopsychic myths'. According to page 43 of the chapter, Freud became enthusiastic about a book by Rudolf Kleinpaul titled "Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage" [The Living and the Dead in Folk Belief, Religion and Legend], published in 1898. After studying this book, Freud discovered the existence of 'endopsychic myths', which refers to the idea that various myths and sagas from different peoples and periods stem from the same unconscious desires. The text explicitly states: "After studying this book he discovered the existence of 'endopsychic myths.'" This clearly identifies Kleinpaul as the author who influenced Freud's belief in endopsychic myths.

============================================================================================

Progress: 5/6 steps completed (83.3%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Search for the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372 using academic databases and search engines
   Notes: I successfully found and accessed the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372. The book is "A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt" by Herman Westerink, published by Leuven University Press in 2013. I was able to download and extract the content of Chapter 2, which is titled "Dark Traces".
Step1 :[?] Identify that the book is about Sigmund Freud (the neurologist in question) (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Based on the information already gathered in Step 0, I can confirm that the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372 is "A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt" by Herman Westerink. The book is indeed about Sigmund Freud, who was a renowned neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis. This confirms that Freud is the neurologist mentioned in the question.
Step2 :[?] Read through Chapter 2 of the book to locate mentions of 'endopsychic myths' (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: I successfully read through Chapter 2 of "A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt" and located the mentions of 'endopsychic myths'. According to page 43 of the chapter, Freud became enthusiastic about a book by Rudolf Kleinpaul titled "Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage" [The Living and the Dead in Folk Belief, Religion and Legend], published in 1898. After studying this book, Freud discovered the existence of 'endopsychic myths', which refers to the idea that various myths and sagas from different peoples and periods stem from the same unconscious desires. The text explicitly states: "After studying this book he discovered the existence of 'endopsychic myths.'" This clearly identifies Kleinpaul as the author who influenced Freud's belief in endopsychic myths.
Step3 :[?] Identify the author who influenced Freud's belief in endopsychic myths according to Chapter 2 (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Based on the information from Chapter 2 of "A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt," I have identified that Rudolf Kleinpaul is the author who influenced Freud's belief in endopsychic myths. According to page 43 of Chapter 2, Freud became enthusiastic about Kleinpaul's book "Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage" [The Living and the Dead in Folk Belief, Religion and Legend], published in 1898. The text explicitly states: "After studying this book he discovered the existence of 'endopsychic myths.'" This clearly establishes Kleinpaul as the influential author in question.
Step4 :[?] Extract the last name of the influential author: Kleinpaul (depends on: 3)
   Notes: I have successfully extracted the last name of the influential author who affected Freud's belief in "endopsychic myths" according to Chapter 2 of the book. The author's name is Rudolf Kleinpaul, and his last name is Kleinpaul. This information was identified in Step 3, where we found that Freud became enthusiastic about Kleinpaul's book "Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage" [The Living and the Dead in Folk Belief, Religion and Legend], published in 1898.
