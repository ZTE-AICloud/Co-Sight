   - Genre: The category of the movie or game
   - Year: The release year of the item
   - Platform: Only populated for video games
   - Status: Current status (Available, Rented, Overdue, Missing)

3. The inventory is organized into three main sections:
   - DVD section (rows 4-10)
   - Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17)
   - Video Games section (rows 18-28)

4. For our task, we need to focus on the Blu-Ray section and identify the oldest one based on the "Year" column.

The data is well-structured with clear headers and sections, making it straightforward to filter and sort to find the oldest Blu-Ray.

2. Cereal Killer III: Incomplete Breakfast (Horror, 2011)
3. Windshield Bug: The First Ten Seasons (Comedy, 2016)
4. A Protist's Life (Documentary, 2018)
5. My Neighbor Is A Shrimp Farmer (Anime, 2022)
6. Dogs and Croatia: A Movie About Both These Things (Adventure, 2023)

All items have been identified and are ready for sorting by year to find the oldest one.
Details: 
Step3 :[ ] Sort the Blu-Ray items by the 'Year' column in ascending order (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Identify the Blu-Ray with the earliest year (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Extract the exact title of the oldest Blu-Ray as it appears in the spreadsheet (depends on: 4)

Looking at the Blu-Ray items identified in Step 2, I can already see that "Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe" from 2009 appears to be the oldest Blu-Ray in the inventory. However, we should continue with the formal process to ensure accuracy.

The remaining steps are still relevant and will lead us to the correct answer. No adjustments are needed to the plan at this point.

Plan: Find the Oldest Blu-Ray Title in the Movie Rental Store Inventory
========================================================================

Progress: 4/8 steps completed (50.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 4 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Access and open the Excel spreadsheet file
   Notes: Successfully accessed and opened the Excel spreadsheet file. The file contains inventory data for a movie and video game rental store called "Flop Video Rental Store" located at "1001 Rewind Drive, Seattle WA". The spreadsheet has been loaded and is ready for analysis.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Review the spreadsheet structure and column headers to understand the data organization (depends on: 0)
   Notes: After reviewing the spreadsheet, I can see the following structure:

1. The spreadsheet contains inventory for "Flop Video Rental Store" located at "1001 Rewind Drive, Seattle WA".
2. The main column headers are:
   - Title: Contains the name of the movie or game
   - Genre: The category of the movie or game
   - Year: The release year of the item
   - Platform: Only populated for video games
   - Status: Current status (Available, Rented, Overdue, Missing)

3. The inventory is organized into three main sections:
   - DVD section (rows 4-10)
   - Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17)
   - Video Games section (rows 18-28)

4. For our task, we need to focus on the Blu-Ray section and identify the oldest one based on the "Year" column.

The data is well-structured with clear headers and sections, making it straightforward to filter and sort to find the oldest Blu-Ray.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Examine the Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17) and identify all Blu-Ray items (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have examined the Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17 in the spreadsheet, which correspond to rows 10-15 in the DataFrame). The Blu-Ray section contains 6 movies:

1. Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe (Science Fiction, 2009)
2. Cereal Killer III: Incomplete Breakfast (Horror, 2011)
3. Windshield Bug: The First Ten Seasons (Comedy, 2016)
4. A Protist's Life (Documentary, 2018)
5. My Neighbor Is A Shrimp Farmer (Anime, 2022)
6. Dogs and Croatia: A Movie About Both These Things (Adventure, 2023)

All items have been identified and are ready for sorting by year to find the oldest one.

Step3 :[?] Sort the Blu-Ray items by the 'Year' column in ascending order (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I have successfully sorted the Blu-Ray items by the 'Year' column in ascending order. After analyzing the data, I found that the Blu-Ray section contains 6 movies with the following years:

1. Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe (2009)
2. Cereal Killer III: Incomplete Breakfast (2011)
3. Windshield Bug: The First Ten Seasons (2016)
4. A Protist's Life (2018)
5. My Neighbor Is A Shrimp Farmer (2022)
6. Dogs and Croatia: A Movie About Both These Things (2023)

The sorting was successful, and the Blu-Ray items are now arranged from oldest to newest based on their release years.
Details: 
Step4 :[ ] Identify the Blu-Ray with the earliest year (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Extract the exact title of the oldest Blu-Ray as it appears in the spreadsheet (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Verify the answer by double-checking the data and sorting criteria (depends on: 5)
Step7 :[ ] Formulate the final answer with the exact title of the oldest Blu-Ray (depends on: 6)

Plan: Find the Oldest Blu-Ray Title in the Movie Rental Store Inventory
========================================================================

Progress: 7/8 steps completed (87.5%)
Status: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Access and open the Excel spreadsheet file
   Notes: Successfully accessed and opened the Excel spreadsheet file. The file contains inventory data for a movie and video game rental store called "Flop Video Rental Store" located at "1001 Rewind Drive, Seattle WA". The spreadsheet has been loaded and is ready for analysis.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Review the spreadsheet structure and column headers to understand the data organization (depends on: 0)
   Notes: After reviewing the spreadsheet, I can see the following structure:

1. The spreadsheet contains inventory for "Flop Video Rental Store" located at "1001 Rewind Drive, Seattle WA".
2. The main column headers are:
   - Title: Contains the name of the movie or game
   - Genre: The category of the movie or game
   - Year: The release year of the item
   - Platform: Only populated for video games
   - Status: Current status (Available, Rented, Overdue, Missing)

3. The inventory is organized into three main sections:
   - DVD section (rows 4-10)
   - Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17)
   - Video Games section (rows 18-28)

4. For our task, we need to focus on the Blu-Ray section and identify the oldest one based on the "Year" column.

The data is well-structured with clear headers and sections, making it straightforward to filter and sort to find the oldest Blu-Ray.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Examine the Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17) and identify all Blu-Ray items (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have examined the Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17 in the spreadsheet, which correspond to rows 10-15 in the DataFrame). The Blu-Ray section contains 6 movies:

1. Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe (Science Fiction, 2009)
2. Cereal Killer III: Incomplete Breakfast (Horror, 2011)
3. Windshield Bug: The First Ten Seasons (Comedy, 2016)
4. A Protist's Life (Documentary, 2018)
5. My Neighbor Is A Shrimp Farmer (Anime, 2022)
6. Dogs and Croatia: A Movie About Both These Things (Adventure, 2023)

All items have been identified and are ready for sorting by year to find the oldest one.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Sort the Blu-Ray items by the 'Year' column in ascending order (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I have successfully sorted the Blu-Ray items by the 'Year' column in ascending order. After analyzing the data, I found that the Blu-Ray section contains 6 movies with the following years:

1. Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe (2009)
2. Cereal Killer III: Incomplete Breakfast (2011)
3. Windshield Bug: The First Ten Seasons (2016)
4. A Protist's Life (2018)
5. My Neighbor Is A Shrimp Farmer (2022)
6. Dogs and Croatia: A Movie About Both These Things (2023)

The sorting was successful, and the Blu-Ray items are now arranged from oldest to newest based on their release years.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Identify the Blu-Ray with the earliest year (depends on: 3)
   Notes: I have successfully identified the Blu-Ray with the earliest year in the inventory. After analyzing the Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17) and sorting by the 'Year' column, I found that the oldest Blu-Ray is "Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe" from 2009. The complete list of Blu-Ray items sorted by year is:

1. Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe (2009)

6. Dogs and Croatia: A Movie About Both These Things (2023)

The oldest Blu-Ray has been clearly identified as "Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe" with a release year of 2009.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Extract the exact title of the oldest Blu-Ray as it appears in the spreadsheet (depends on: 4)
   Notes: I have successfully extracted the exact title of the oldest Blu-Ray as it appears in the spreadsheet. After analyzing the Blu-Ray section (rows 11-17) and sorting by the 'Year' column, I confirmed that the oldest Blu-Ray is "Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe" from 2009.
