After analyzing the PDF document listing accommodations in Seahorse Island, I extracted and organized the ratings for each accommodation type:

1. Hotels (5 listings): [5, 5, 4, 3, 2]
2. Motels (5 listings): [5, 3, 2, 1, 0]
3. Rental Houses (10 listings): [4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1]
4. Campgrounds (5 listings): [4, 5, 3, 4, 1]

I then calculated the average rating for each type:
1. Hotels: 19 ÷ 5 = 3.80
2. Motels: 11 ÷ 5 = 2.20
3. Rental Houses: 35 ÷ 10 = 3.50
4. Campgrounds: 17 ÷ 5 = 3.40

Comparing these averages, Hotels have the highest average rating at 3.80 out of 5, followed by Rental Houses (3.50), Campgrounds (3.40), and Motels (2.20).

The question asks which type of accommodation has a higher average rating, so the answer is Hotels.
