Step2 :[?] Determine which of Rick Riordan's books are not currently on the shelves (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Based on the information gathered in Step 1, I've determined which of Rick Riordan's books are not currently on the library's shelves. Books that are not on the shelves would have either "Checked Out" or "Overdue" status.

The Rick Riordan books that are NOT currently on the shelves are:
1. The Battle of the Labyrinth (Status: Checked Out)
2. The Last Olympian (Status: Checked Out)
3. The Lost Hero (Status: Checked Out)
4. The Son of Neptune (Status: Checked Out)
5. The Mark of Athena (Status: Checked Out)
6. The House of Hades (Status: Overdue)
7. The Blood of Olympus (Status: Overdue)

The Rick Riordan books that ARE currently on the shelves are:
1. The Lightning Thief (Status: Available)
2. The Titan's Curse (Status: Available)

This information will be used in the next step to count the total number of Rick Riordan books not on shelves.

Step3 :[?] Count the total number of Rick Riordan books not on shelves (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've counted the total number of Rick Riordan books that are not currently on the library's shelves. Based on the information from Step 2, there are 7 Rick Riordan books that are not on the shelves:

- 5 books with "Checked Out" status:
  1. The Battle of the Labyrinth

  3. The Lost Hero
  4. The Son of Neptune
  5. The Mark of Athena

- 2 books with "Overdue" status:
  1. The House of Hades
  2. The Blood of Olympus

Therefore, the total count of Rick Riordan books not on the library's shelves is 7.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Formulate and provide the final answer (depends on: 3)
