Steps:
Step0 :[?] Use standard density values: honey = 1.42 g/cm? and mayonnaise = 0.91 g/cm? at 25£C
   Notes: Using the standard density values provided in the plan: honey = 1.42 g/cm? and mayonnaise = 0.91 g/cm? at 25£C. These values are from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as specified in the problem.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Convert volume units: 1 gallon = 3.78541 liters = 3785.41 cm?, 1 cup = 236.588 cm? (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully converted the volume units:
- 1 US gallon = 3.78541 liters = 3785.41 cm?
- 1 US cup = 236.588 cm?

These are standard conversion factors that will be used in subsequent calculations.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Calculate the weight of 1 gallon of honey: 3785.41 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 5375.28 g (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: Successfully calculated the weight of 1 gallon of honey:
- Volume of 1 gallon = 3785.41 cm?
- Density of honey = 1.42 g/cm?
- Weight of 1 gallon of honey = 3785.41 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 5375.28 g

This calculation confirms the expected result in the plan and will be used in subsequent steps to determine how many cups of honey need to be removed.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Calculate the weight of 1 gallon of mayonnaise: 3785.41 cm?  0.91 g/cm? = 3444.72 g (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: Step 2: step_status is completed, step_notes is Calculated the weight of 1 gallon of honey:
3785.41 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 5375.28 g

This calculation uses the volume of 1 gallon (3785.41 cm?) and multiplies it by the density of honey (1.42 g/cm?) to get the total weight of 1 gallon of honey. 
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Calculate the weight of 1 cup of honey: 236.588 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 335.95 g (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: Step 2: step_status is completed, step_notes is Calculated the weight of 1 gallon of honey:
Weight = Volume  Density
Weight = 3785.41 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 5375.28 g

This is the initial weight of the full gallon of honey before any cups are removed. 
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Calculate how many cups of honey to remove: (5375.28 - 3444.72)  335.95 = 5.75 cups, so 6 cups needed (depends on: 2, 3, 4)
   Notes: Calculated how many cups of honey need to be removed:
- Initial weight of honey: 5375.28 g
- Weight of mayonnaise: 3444.72 g
- Weight difference: 1930.56 g
- Weight of 1 cup of honey: 335.95 g
- Cups to remove (exact): 1930.56 g  335.95 g = 5.7465 cups
- Since we can only remove whole cups, we need to remove 6 cups

This calculation confirms that 6 cups of honey need to be removed for the honey to weigh less than the mayonnaise.
Details: 
Step6 :[ ] Verify: Initial honey (5375.28g) - 6 cups (6  335.95g = 2015.7g) = 3359.58g, which is less than mayonnaise (3444.72g) (depends on: 5)

- Weight of 1 gallon of honey = 3785.41 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 5375.28 g

This calculation confirms the expected result in the plan and will be used in subsequent steps to determine how many cups of honey need to be removed.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Calculate the weight of 1 gallon of mayonnaise: 3785.41 cm?  0.91 g/cm? = 3444.72 g (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: Step 2: step_status is completed, step_notes is Calculated the weight of 1 gallon of honey:
3785.41 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 5375.28 g

This calculation uses the volume of 1 gallon (3785.41 cm?) and multiplies it by the density of honey (1.42 g/cm?) to get the total weight of 1 gallon of honey. 
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Calculate the weight of 1 cup of honey: 236.588 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 335.95 g (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: Step 2: step_status is completed, step_notes is Calculated the weight of 1 gallon of honey:
Weight = Volume  Density
Weight = 3785.41 cm?  1.42 g/cm? = 5375.28 g

This is the initial weight of the full gallon of honey before any cups are removed. 
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Calculate how many cups of honey to remove: (5375.28 - 3444.72)  335.95 = 5.75 cups, so 6 cups needed (depends on: 2, 3, 4)
   Notes: Calculated how many cups of honey need to be removed:
- Initial weight of honey: 5375.28 g
- Weight of mayonnaise: 3444.72 g
- Weight difference: 1930.56 g
- Weight of 1 cup of honey: 335.95 g
- Cups to remove (exact): 1930.56 g  335.95 g = 5.7465 cups
- Since we can only remove whole cups, we need to remove 6 cups

This calculation confirms that 6 cups of honey need to be removed for the honey to weigh less than the mayonnaise.
Details: 
Step6 :[?] Verify: Initial honey (5375.28g) - 6 cups (6  335.95g = 2015.7g) = 3359.58g, which is less than mayonnaise (3444.72g) (depends on: 5)
   Notes: Verified the calculation:
- Initial honey weight: 5375.28 g
- Mayonnaise weight: 3444.72 g
- Weight of 1 cup of honey: 335.95 g
- Weight of 6 cups of honey: 2015.73 g
- Remaining honey weight after removing 6 cups: 3359.55 g
- The remaining honey weight (3359.55 g) is less than the mayonnaise weight (3444.72 g) by 85.17 g

This confirms that removing 6 cups of honey will make the honey weigh less than the mayonnaise.
