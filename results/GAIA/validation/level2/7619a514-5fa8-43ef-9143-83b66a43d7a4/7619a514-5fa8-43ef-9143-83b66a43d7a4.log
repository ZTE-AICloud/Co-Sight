Detailed plan: ### Task Restatement

The goal is to find the oldest closed issue in the NumPy GitHub repository that has the 'Regression' label and contains the word 'polynomial' in either the title or the description. The steps involve navigating the issues page, applying filters, and sorting the results to identify the correct issue.

### Detailed Plan to Solve the Task

1. **Open the GitHub Issues Page**:
   - Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues`.

2. **Filter for Closed Issues**:
   - Look for the filter options on the issues page.
   - Select the filter for closed issues. This may involve clicking on a dropdown or a checkbox that specifies the issue status.

3. **Search for Issues with 'Regression' Label**:
   - Use the search bar at the top of the issues page.
   - Enter the search query to filter issues by label. The query should be something like: `label:"Regression" is:closed`.
   - This will narrow down the results to only those closed issues that have the 'Regression' label.

4. **Include 'polynomial' in Title or Description**:
   - Modify the search query to include the keyword 'polynomial'. The updated query should look like: `label:"Regression" is:closed polynomial`.
   - This will filter the results further to only show issues that are closed, have the 'Regression' label, and contain the word 'polynomial' in either the title or description.

5. **Sort the Results by Oldest**:
   - Look for sorting options on the issues page.
   - Select the option to sort the issues by the oldest date. This may be a dropdown menu or a button that allows you to change the sorting order.

6. **Review the Results**:
   - Once sorted, review the list of issues to find the oldest one that meets the criteria.
   - Click on the issue title to open it and verify that it indeed has the 'Regression' label and contains 'polynomial' in the title or description.

7. **Document the Findings**:
   - Take note of the issue number, title, and any relevant details from the issue page for future reference.

### Considerations
- Be aware that the GitHub interface may change, so the exact steps may vary slightly.
- If no issues are found that meet the criteria, be prepared to adjust the search terms or filters accordingly.
- Ensure that the search is case-insensitive and accounts for variations in wording related to 'polynomial'.
Observation: The GitHub issues page for NumPy is open. There are options to filter issues by state (Open, Closed) and by labels, projects, milestones, etc. The search bar is visible at the top of the issues list.
Reasoning: To find the oldest closed issue with the 'Regression' label and 'polynomial' in the title or description, I need to first filter for closed issues. The 'Closed' filter option is visible. Selecting this will narrow down the issues to only those that are closed.
Action code: click_id(156)
Observation: The GitHub issues page is now filtered to show closed issues. The search bar is available for further filtering. There are options to filter by labels and sort the issues.
Reasoning: The next step is to filter the issues by the 'Regression' label and include 'polynomial' in the search. I will use the search bar to enter the query
Action code: fill_input_id(406, 'label:\"Regression\" is:closed polynomial')
Observation: The search query 'label:"Regression" is:closed polynomial' returned no matches. The filter by label dropdown is open.
Reasoning: Since the search query returned no matches, it's possible that there are no issues meeting all the criteria. I should verify the label 'Regression' is correctly applied by using the label filter dropdown to ensure the label exists and is correctly spelled.
Action code: click_id(417)
2025-04-28 15:04:27,341 - camel.camel.toolkits.web_toolkit - WARNING - Error while executing the action: Error while executing the action click_id(417): No such element.. If timeout, please recheck whether you have provided the correct identifier.
Observation: The search query returned no matches. The label filter dropdown is open, but the 'Regression' label is not visible in the current viewport.
Reasoning: Since the 'Regression' label is not visible, I should scroll through the label dropdown to check if it exists. This will help confirm whether the label is available for filtering.
Action code: scroll_down()
Observation: The search query returned no matches. The label filter dropdown is open, but the 'Regression' label is not visible in the current viewport.
Reasoning: Since scrolling did not reveal the 'Regression' label, I should try using the search bar to search for 'Regression' to ensure it exists. This will help confirm whether the label is available for filtering.
Action code: fill_input_id(542, 'Regression')
Observation: The 'Regression' label is visible in the label filter dropdown.
Reasoning: Now that the 'Regression' label is visible, I should select it to filter the issues accordingly. This will help narrow down the search to issues with the 'Regression' label.
Action code: click_id(546)
Observation: The 'Regression' label is selected in the label filter dropdown. The issues list is visible, but not yet filtered by the 'Regression' label.
Reasoning: Now that the 'Regression' label is selected, I should apply the filter to update the issues list. This will help narrow down the search to issues with the 'Regression' label.
Action code: click_blank_area()
Observation: The issues list is now filtered by the 'Regression' label. The issues are sorted by newest by default.
Reasoning: To find the oldest issue, I need to change the sorting order from newest to oldest. This will allow me to identify the oldest closed issue with the 'Regression' label.

Detailed plan: ### Task Restatement

The task is to find the oldest closed issue related to the `numpy.polynomial` module that has the `Regression` label on the GitHub repository for NumPy. This involves browsing the issues on the GitHub page, filtering for closed issues with the specified label, and identifying the one with the earliest date.

### Detailed Plan

1. **Visit the GitHub Issues Page**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression+polynomial`.

2. **Review the Page Layout**:
   - Once on the page, observe the layout to understand how issues are displayed. Look for the list of closed issues that match the `Regression` label and are related to `numpy.polynomial`.

3. **Identify the Filtered Issues**:
   - Check the list of issues that appear. Each issue should display a title, a brief description, and the date it was closed. Ensure that the issues are indeed filtered by the `Regression` label.

4. **Sort the Issues by Date**:
   - If the issues are not automatically sorted by date, look for sorting options on the page. If available, select the option to sort by the date closed (oldest first). If sorting is not available, you will need to manually check the dates.

5. **Examine Each Issue**:
   - Go through the list of issues one by one. For each issue, note the date it was closed. Pay attention to the format of the date to ensure accurate comparisons.

6. **Identify the Oldest Issue**:
   - As you review the issues, keep track of the oldest date encountered. Once you have gone through all the issues, identify which one has the earliest closed date.

7. **Document the Findings**:
   - Once the oldest closed issue is identified, document the title, date closed, and any relevant details about the issue for reference.

8. **Verify the Information**:
   - Double-check the details of the identified issue to ensure accuracy. Make sure it is indeed related to `numpy.polynomial` and has the `Regression` label.

9. **Conclude the Task**:
   - Summarize the findings, including the title and date of the oldest closed issue related to `numpy.polynomial` with the `Regression` label.

### Note
- Be prepared for potential changes in the GitHub interface or the way issues are displayed, as this may affect the steps slightly.
- If there are many issues, it may take some time to go through them all, so patience is key.

Detailed plan: ### Task Restatement

The task is to find the oldest closed issue related to `numpy.polynomial` that has the `Regression` label on GitHub. The provided URL already sorts the issues by their creation date in ascending order, meaning the oldest issues will be listed first. The goal is to examine the first few issues on this page, noting their issue numbers and creation dates.

### Detailed Plan to Solve the Task

1. **Open the Webpage**: Start by navigating to the provided URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression+polynomial+sort%3Acreated-asc`.

2. **Identify the Issue List**: Once the page loads, locate the section that lists the closed issues. This section should display the issues in a list format, with the oldest issues at the top.

3. **Examine the First Few Issues**:
   - Scroll down to view the first few issues listed on the page.
   - Since the page is sorted by creation date, the first few entries will be the oldest closed issues related to `numpy.polynomial` with the `Regression` label.

4. **Note Down Details**: For each of the first few issues:
   - Record the issue number (usually found in the format `#1234`).
   - Record the creation date (this may be displayed next to the issue title or in the issue details).

5. **Summarize Findings**: After noting the details of the first few issues, summarize the findings by listing the issue numbers and their corresponding creation dates.

6. **Check for Additional Information**: If necessary, click on the issue titles to view more details about each issue, but this step is optional if the required information is already visible.

7. **Conclude the Task**: Once the information is gathered, conclude the task by ensuring all noted details are accurate and complete.

### Considerations
- Be aware that the page may load additional issues as you scroll, so ensure you are only focusing on the first few entries.
- If the page does not display any issues, it may be necessary to check the filters or the URL for correctness.
- The task may require some patience if the page takes time to load or if there are many issues to sift through.
Observation: The page shows a search filter with the query 'is:issue is:closed label:Regression polynomial sort:created-asc'. There is a message indicating 'Invalid value Regression for label'. No issues are displayed, and the filter shows 0 open and 0 closed issues.
Reasoning: The current filter is not returning any results because the label 'Regression' is invalid. To proceed, I need to adjust the search filter to use a valid label. I will click on the 'Labels' dropdown to see available labels and select a valid one related to regression.
Action code: click_id(153)
Observation: The page displays a list of labels available for filtering issues. The label '06 - Regression' is visible among the options.
Reasoning: The label '06 - Regression' seems to be the correct label to use for filtering issues related to regression. I will select this label to adjust the search filter and find the relevant issues.
Action code: click_id(330)
Observation: The page shows a list of closed issues with the '06 - Regression' label. The oldest issue visible is '#20855' titled 'BUG: genfromtxt now ignores names=('column1', 'column2') when unpack=True', created on Jan 19, 2022.

Detailed plan: ### Task Restatement
The task is to investigate issue #10881 on the NumPy GitHub repository to determine when the "Regression" label was added to this issue. This involves checking the timeline or history section of the issue to find the exact date when the label was added. The date should be formatted in MM/DD/YY.

### Detailed Plan to Solve the Task

1. **Open the Webpage**:
   - Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10881`.

2. **Locate the Issue**:
   - Ensure that you are viewing issue #10881. Confirm that the title and content of the issue match what is expected.

3. **Find the Labels Section**:
   - Scroll down the page to locate the labels section, which is typically found near the top of the issue, just below the title and issue number.

4. **Access the Timeline/History**:
   - Look for a section that shows the timeline or history of changes made to the issue. This may be labeled as "Activity" or "Timeline" and is usually found towards the bottom of the issue page.

5. **Search for Label Changes**:
   - In the timeline or history section, look for entries that indicate changes to the labels. This may be phrased as "added label" or similar.

6. **Identify the Date**:
   - Once you find the entry that mentions the addition of the "Regression" label, note the date associated with that entry.

7. **Format the Date**:
   - Convert the date into the required MM/DD/YY format if it is not already in that format.

8. **Document the Result**:
   - Write down the exact date when the "Regression" label was added to issue #10881.

### Additional Considerations
- Be aware that the timeline may contain multiple entries, so ensure you are looking specifically for the addition of the "Regression" label.
- If the label was added in a comment or by a specific user, make sure to note that context as well, as it may be relevant for understanding the issue's history.
- If the label is not found, consider checking if there are any filters applied that might hide certain activities.

Using Tool: <function browser_simulation at 0x000001A746EE42C0>
Detailed plan: ### Task Restatement

The task is to examine the issue page for a specific GitHub issue (issue number 10881 in the NumPy repository) to find information about when the "06 - Regression" label was added. This involves checking the timeline section or any other relevant part of the page that might provide a history of label changes. The goal is to take note of any dates associated with the "06 - Regression" label.

### Detailed Plan to Solve the Task

1. **Open the Webpage**:
   - Launch a web browser and navigate to the URL `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10881`.

2. **Locate the Timeline Section**:
   - Scroll down the page to find the timeline section. This section typically contains a chronological list of events related to the issue, including comments, status changes, and label modifications.

3. **Identify Label Changes**:
   - Carefully read through the timeline entries to identify any mentions of label changes. Look specifically for entries that indicate when the "06 - Regression" label was added or modified.

4. **Take Note of Dates**:
   - If you find an entry related to the "06 - Regression" label, note the date associated with that entry. If there are multiple entries, make sure to record all relevant dates.

5. **Check Other Sections (if necessary)**:
   - If the timeline does not provide sufficient information, check other sections of the issue page, such as comments or the labels section, to see if there are any additional details about the label history.

6. **Summarize Findings**:
   - After gathering the information, summarize your findings regarding the "06 - Regression" label, including any dates you noted.

7. **Close the Browser**:
   - Once you have completed your examination and noted the necessary information, you can close the browser.

### Considerations
- Be aware that the timeline may not explicitly state when a label was added; it may require some interpretation of the events listed.
- If the label was added in a comment or through a pull request, it may not be immediately obvious, so thorough reading is essential.
- The information may be partially observable, meaning that not all details may be available, and some assumptions may need to be made based on the available data.
Observation: The current viewport shows a GitHub issue page for NumPy with the title 'Not working rundocs() in numpy\lib\tests\test_polynomial.py #10881'. The issue is closed. There are comments from users 'andrzejQ' and 'mattip'. The timeline shows comments with dates: April 11, 2018, April 13, 2018, and April 15, 2018. On the right side, there is a 'Labels' section showing '06 - Regression', 'component: numpy.polynomial', and 'component: numpy.testing'.
Reasoning: To find when the '06 - Regression' label was added, I need to examine the timeline section for any entries related to label changes. Since the current viewport does not show any label change events, I should scroll down to see more of the timeline.
Action code: scroll_down()
Observation: The current viewport shows a continuation of the GitHub issue timeline. It includes a comment from 'mattip' on April 15, 2018, discussing a file change. Below, there is an entry where 'mattip' added the '06 - Regression' label on April 15, 2018. Further down, there are additional comments and actions related to the issue.
Reasoning: I have found the information about when the '06 - Regression' label was added. It was added by 'mattip' on April 15, 2018. Since the task was to find the date associated with this label, the task is now complete.
Action code: stop()
browser_simulation execute result = The task was to find information about when the "06 - Regression" label was added to a specific GitHub issue in the NumPy repository. After examining the issue page and timeline, it was found that the "06 - Regression" label was added by the user "mattip" on April 15, 2018. This completes the task successfully.
