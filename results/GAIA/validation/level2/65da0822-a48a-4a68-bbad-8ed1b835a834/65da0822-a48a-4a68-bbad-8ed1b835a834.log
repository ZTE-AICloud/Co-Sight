re-plan_result is I'll continue with the current plan, which is well-structured for answering the question. Let's proceed with the next steps based on the information we already have about the former Homeland Security Secretaries.

The plan is appropriate and doesn't need adjustment. We've already completed Step 0 by identifying the six individuals who formally held the position of US Secretary of Homeland Security prior to April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries). Now we need to continue with researching their educational backgrounds and determining the geographic locations of their universities.

Let's continue with the execution of the current plan:

For Step 1, we need to research where each of these six secretaries earned their bachelor's degrees:

1. Tom Ridge - Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts)
2. Michael Chertoff - Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts)
3. Janet Napolitano - Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, California)
4. Jeh Johnson - Morehouse College (Atlanta, Georgia)
5. John F. Kelly - University of Massachusetts Boston (Boston, Massachusetts)
6. Kirstjen Nielsen - Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (Washington, D.C.)

For Step 2, we can compile the list of universities:
- Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts)
- Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, California)
- Morehouse College (Atlanta, Georgia)
- University of Massachusetts Boston (Boston, Massachusetts)
- Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.)

For Step 3, the approximate coordinates of these universities are:
- Harvard University: 42.3770° N, 71.1167° W
- Santa Clara University: 37.3496° N, 121.9390° W
- Morehouse College: 33.7459° N, 84.4140° W
- University of Massachusetts Boston: 42.3149° N, 71.0400° W
- Georgetown University: 38.9076° N, 77.0723° W

For Step 4, comparing the longitudes:
- Santa Clara University (121.9390° W) is the westernmost
- Harvard University (71.1167° W) and UMass Boston (71.0400° W) are the easternmost, with UMass Boston being slightly more east

For Step 5, the cities are:
- Westernmost: Santa Clara, California
- Easternmost: Boston, Massachusetts (UMass Boston)

For Step 6, the answer formatted as requested:

We've already completed Steps 0, 1, and 2, so we should continue with the execution of the remaining steps.\n\nLet's proceed with Step 3 and determine the geographic coordinates of each university:\n\nFor the universities identified in Step 2, here are their approximate geographic coordinates:\n\n1.

re-plan_result is The current plan is well-structured and appropriate for answering the question. We've already completed Steps 0, 1, and 2, so we should continue with the execution of the remaining steps.

Let's proceed with Step 3 and determine the geographic coordinates of each university:

For the universities identified in Step 2, here are their approximate geographic coordinates:

1. Harvard University (Cambridge, MA): 42.3770° N, 71.1167° W
2. Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, CA): 37.3496° N, 121.9390° W
3. Morehouse College (Atlanta, GA): 33.7459° N, 84.4140° W
4. University of Massachusetts Boston (Boston, MA): 42.3149° N, 71.0400° W
5. Georgetown University (Washington, DC): 38.9076° N, 77.0723° W

Now for Step 4, we need to identify the westernmost and easternmost universities by comparing their longitudes:

- In the western hemisphere, longitude is expressed as negative degrees (°W), so the westernmost university will have the largest negative value (or highest absolute value).
- The easternmost university will have the smallest negative value (or lowest absolute value).

Comparing the longitudes:
- Santa Clara University: 121.9390° W (westernmost - largest negative value)
- Morehouse College: 84.4140° W
- Georgetown University: 77.0723° W
- Harvard University: 71.1167° W
- University of Massachusetts Boston: 71.0400° W (easternmost - smallest negative value)

Therefore:
- Westernmost university: Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, CA)
- Easternmost university: University of Massachusetts Boston (Boston, MA)

For Step 5, we've already identified the cities where these two universities are located:
- Westernmost: Santa Clara, California
- Easternmost: Boston, Massachusetts

For Step 6, formatting the answer as a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first:

re-plan_result is The current plan is well-structured and appropriate for answering the question. We've already completed Steps 0, 1, 2, and 3, so we should continue with the execution of the remaining steps.

Let's proceed with Step 4 and identify the westernmost and easternmost universities based on the longitude coordinates:

For longitude coordinates in the western hemisphere (which all of these universities are in), the values are negative. The westernmost university will have the largest negative value (furthest west), and the easternmost university will have the smallest negative value (furthest east).

Looking at the longitude values from Step 3:
1. Harvard University: -71.116943
2. Santa Clara University: -121.9362
3. Morehouse College: -84.4092
4. University of Massachusetts Boston: -71.0384
5. Georgetown University: -77.072807

The westernmost university (largest negative longitude value) is Santa Clara University at -121.9362.
The easternmost university (smallest negative longitude value) is University of Massachusetts Boston at -71.0384.

Now for Step 5, we need to determine the cities where these two universities are located:
- Westernmost university (Santa Clara University) is located in Santa Clara, California
- Easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) is located in Boston, Massachusetts

For Step 6, we format the answer as a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first:

   Notes: Based on the research from Step 1, I've compiled a comprehensive list of all universities where the former US Secretaries of Homeland Security earned their bachelor's degrees:

1. Harvard University (Cambridge, MA) - Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff
2. Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, CA) - Janet Napolitano
3. Morehouse College (Atlanta, GA) - Jeh Johnson
4. University of Massachusetts Boston (Boston, MA) - John F. Kelly
5. Georgetown University (Washington, DC) - Kirstjen Nielsen

This list includes all six secretaries who formally held the position prior to April 2019, excluding those in acting capacity. Each university is listed with its location to prepare for the next step of determining geographic coordinates.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Determine the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of each university (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've successfully determined the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) for each university where the former US Secretaries of Homeland Security earned their bachelor's degrees:

1. Harvard University (Cambridge, MA): 
   - Latitude: 42.374443
   - Longitude: -71.116943

2. Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, CA):
   - Latitude: 37.3428
   - Longitude: -121.9362

3. Morehouse College (Atlanta, GA):
   - Latitude: 33.7413
   - Longitude: -84.4092

4. University of Massachusetts Boston (Boston, MA):
   - Latitude: 42.3134
   - Longitude: -71.0384

5. Georgetown University (Washington, DC):
   - Latitude: 38.907852
   - Longitude: -77.072807

These coordinates will be used in the next step to determine which university is the westernmost (lowest longitude value) and which is the easternmost (highest longitude value).
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Identify the westernmost university (lowest longitude value) and the easternmost university (highest longitude value) (depends on: 3)
   Notes: I've successfully identified the westernmost and easternmost universities based on their longitude coordinates:

1. Westernmost University: Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, CA (Longitude: -121.9362)
   - This is the university where Janet Napolitano earned her bachelor's degree.

2. Easternmost University: University of Massachusetts Boston in Boston, MA (Longitude: -71.0384)
   - This is the university where John F. Kelly earned his bachelor's degree.

The analysis was performed by comparing the longitude values of all universities. Since we're in the western hemisphere, the westernmost university has the most negative longitude value, while the easternmost has the least negative longitude value.

Note: While Harvard University in Cambridge (Longitude: -71.116943) is very close to UMass Boston in longitude, UMass Boston is slightly further east.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Determine the cities where these two universities are located (depends on: 4)
   Notes: I've confirmed the cities where the westernmost and easternmost universities are located:

1. Westernmost University: Santa Clara University is located in Santa Clara, California.
2. Easternmost University: University of Massachusetts Boston is located in Boston, Massachusetts.

These city names will be used in the final answer as requested in the original question.
