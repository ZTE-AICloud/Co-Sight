result of search_wiki: Goldfinger is the seventh novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series. Written in January and February 1958, it was first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959. The story centres on the investigation by the British Secret Service operative James Bond into the gold-smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence organisation. As well as establishing the background to the smuggling operation, Bond uncovers a much larger plot: Goldfinger plans to steal the gold reserves of the United States from Fort Knox.
Fleming developed the James Bond character in Goldfinger, presenting him as a more complex individual than in the previous novels, and bringing out a theme of Bond as a St George figure.

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Research the ending scene of Goldfinger where James Bond and Pussy Galore conceal themselves
   Notes: I researched the ending scene of Goldfinger and found that James Bond and Pussy Galore used a parachute to escape from a plane that was in a nosedive. According to the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, which houses the original prop, the parachute was orange and white in color. The description states: "With the jet in a nosedive, plummeting towards the sea, Bond and Pussy Galore leap to safety using the parachute. On the ground the escape item proves useful, concealing their passionate embrace from potential rescuers." This confirms that the parachute was the object used to conceal themselves at the end of the film.
