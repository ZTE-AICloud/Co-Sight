The Excel file contains detailed information about multiple applicants and their qualifications. In the next step, I'll review the PDF content more thoroughly to understand all qualification requirements.
Step1 :[?] Review the PDF content to identify the job qualifications list (depends on: 0)
   Notes: After reviewing the PDF content, I've identified the complete list of job qualifications:

1. Masters Degree or higher in biology, biochemistry, or biotechnology
2. 3+ years of experience
3. Training with laboratory equipment
4. 3+ publications in the field of biotechnology
5. Citizenship in X Country
6. C++, C#, or Fortran programming experience
7. 1+ second language

The Excel file contains applicant data with columns that correspond to these qualifications:
- "Degree Field" and "Degree Level" for qualification #1
- "Experience (Years)" for qualification #2
- "Lab Trained (Y/N)" for qualification #3
- "Publications" for qualification #4
- "Citizen (Y/N)" for qualification #5
- "Programming Lang" for qualification #6
- "Second Language" for qualification #7

In the next step, I'll analyze the Excel data to determine which applicants are missing only one qualification.
Step2 :[?] Analyze the Excel file to determine which applicants are missing only one qualification (depends on: 0, 1)
   Notes: I've analyzed the Excel file to determine which applicants are missing only one qualification. After carefully checking each qualification for all applicants, I found that 17 applicants are missing exactly one qualification.

The qualifications required for the job are:
1. Masters Degree or higher in biology, biochemistry, or biotechnology
2. 3+ years of experience
3. Training with laboratory equipment
4. 3+ publications in the field of biotechnology
5. Citizenship in X Country
6. C++, C#, or Fortran programming experience
7. 1+ second language

I wrote Python code to analyze each applicant's qualifications against these requirements. For each applicant, I checked if they met each qualification and counted how many qualifications they were missing.

The 17 applicants missing exactly one qualification are:
1. Nabil Bates (missing: Publications)
2. Safwan Sanders (missing: Degree)
3. Tiana Rubio (missing: Lab Training)
4. Amelia Molina (missing: Degree)
5. Chester Gilmore (missing: Lab Training)
