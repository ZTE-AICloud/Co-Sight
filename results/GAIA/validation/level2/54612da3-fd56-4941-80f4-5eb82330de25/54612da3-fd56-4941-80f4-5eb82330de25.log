Plan does not need adjustment, continue execution

The next step is to identify all steam locomotives in the collection, followed by determining their wheel configurations, calculating the total wheels, and verifying the final answer. The current plan structure is logical and follows the necessary sequence to answer the question about the total number of wheels on the steam locomotives in the museum collection.

Plan: Calculate Total Wheels of Steam Locomotives in Museum Collection
=======================================================================

Progress: 3/4 steps completed (75.0%)
Status: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Access and open the Excel file containing the locomotive collection data
   Notes: Successfully accessed and opened the Excel file containing the locomotive collection data. The file shows various types of locomotives including steam, diesel, and traction/other categories. The data includes locomotive numbers, wheel configurations, operating status, and current location/excursion information.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify all steam locomotives in the collection (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully identified all steam locomotives in the collection. The Excel file contains 7 steam locomotives with the following details:

1. Locomotive #1060: Wheel configuration 0-4-0 (4 wheels)
2. Locomotive #31: Wheel configuration 0-4-0 (4 wheels)
3. Locomotive #18: Wheel configuration 4-4-0 (8 wheels)
4. Locomotive #825: Wheel configuration 2-6-0 (8 wheels)
5. Locomotive #52: Wheel configuration 2-8-0 (10 wheels)
6. Locomotive #89: Wheel configuration 2-6-4 (12 wheels)
7. Locomotive #266: Wheel configuration 2-8-4 (14 wheels)

The Whyte notation used for steam locomotives indicates the number of wheels in each position (leading-driving-trailing). For example, a 2-8-4 locomotive has 2 leading wheels, 8 driving wheels, and 4 trailing wheels, for a total of 14 wheels.

All steam locomotives are clearly identified in the Excel file, separated from diesel and traction/other locomotives.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Calculate the sum of all wheels across the identified steam locomotives (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully calculated the total number of wheels across all steam locomotives in the museum collection. 

I analyzed the Excel file and identified 7 steam locomotives with their wheel configurations in Whyte notation. For each locomotive, I calculated the total number of wheels by summing the numbers in the wheel configuration:

1. Locomotive #1060: 0-4-0 = 4 wheels
2. Locomotive #31: 0-4-0 = 4 wheels
3. Locomotive #18: 4-4-0 = 8 wheels
4. Locomotive #825: 2-6-0 = 8 wheels
5. Locomotive #52: 2-8-0 = 10 wheels
6. Locomotive #89: 2-6-4 = 12 wheels
7. Locomotive #266: 2-8-4 = 14 wheels

The total number of wheels across all steam locomotives is 60 wheels.

This calculation was verified using both automated and manual methods, and both approaches yielded the same result.

Plan: Calculate Total Wheels of Steam Locomotives in Museum Collection
=======================================================================

Progress: 4/4 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Access and open the Excel file containing the locomotive collection data
   Notes: Successfully accessed and opened the Excel file containing the locomotive collection data. The file shows various types of locomotives including steam, diesel, and traction/other categories. The data includes locomotive numbers, wheel configurations, operating status, and current location/excursion information.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Identify all steam locomotives in the collection (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully identified all steam locomotives in the collection. The Excel file contains 7 steam locomotives with the following details:

1. Locomotive #1060: Wheel configuration 0-4-0 (4 wheels)
2. Locomotive #31: Wheel configuration 0-4-0 (4 wheels)
3. Locomotive #18: Wheel configuration 4-4-0 (8 wheels)
4. Locomotive #825: Wheel configuration 2-6-0 (8 wheels)
5. Locomotive #52: Wheel configuration 2-8-0 (10 wheels)
6. Locomotive #89: Wheel configuration 2-6-4 (12 wheels)
7. Locomotive #266: Wheel configuration 2-8-4 (14 wheels)

The Whyte notation used for steam locomotives indicates the number of wheels in each position (leading-driving-trailing). For example, a 2-8-4 locomotive has 2 leading wheels, 8 driving wheels, and 4 trailing wheels, for a total of 14 wheels.

All steam locomotives are clearly identified in the Excel file, separated from diesel and traction/other locomotives.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Calculate the sum of all wheels across the identified steam locomotives (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully calculated the total number of wheels across all steam locomotives in the museum collection. 

I analyzed the Excel file and identified 7 steam locomotives with their wheel configurations in Whyte notation. For each locomotive, I calculated the total number of wheels by summing the numbers in the wheel configuration:

1. Locomotive #1060: 0-4-0 = 4 wheels
2. Locomotive #31: 0-4-0 = 4 wheels
3. Locomotive #18: 4-4-0 = 8 wheels
4. Locomotive #825: 2-6-0 = 8 wheels
5. Locomotive #52: 2-8-0 = 10 wheels
6. Locomotive #89: 2-6-4 = 12 wheels
7. Locomotive #266: 2-8-4 = 14 wheels

The total number of wheels across all steam locomotives is 60 wheels.

This calculation was verified using both automated and manual methods, and both approaches yielded the same result.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Verify calculations and prepare final answer (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I have verified the calculations for the total number of wheels on the steam locomotives in the museum collection. 

First, I confirmed the data in the Excel file, which shows 7 steam locomotives with the following wheel configurations:
1. Locomotive #1060: 0-4-0 (4 wheels)
2. Locomotive #31: 0-4-0 (4 wheels)
3. Locomotive #18: 4-4-0 (8 wheels)
4. Locomotive #825: 2-6-0 (8 wheels)
5. Locomotive #52: 2-8-0 (10 wheels)
6. Locomotive #89: 2-6-4 (12 wheels)
7. Locomotive #266: 2-8-4 (14 wheels)

I then performed both automated and manual calculations to verify the total:
- Using a Python script to parse the Whyte notation and sum the wheels
- Manually adding up the individual wheel counts

Both methods confirmed that the total number of wheels across all steam locomotives in the museum collection is 60 wheels.

I also verified my understanding of the Whyte notation system, which is the standard classification method for steam locomotives by wheel arrangement. In this notation, the numbers represent the count of wheels in each position (leading-driving-trailing), and the total number of wheels is the sum of these numbers.

Final answer: The listed steam locomotives in the North American railroad museum collection have a total of 60 wheels.

After analyzing the Excel file containing the locomotive collection data from a North American railroad museum, I identified 7 steam locomotives with their respective wheel configurations in Whyte notation. The Whyte notation indicates the number of wheels in each position (leading-driving-trailing).

The steam locomotives in the collection are:
1. Locomotive #1060: 0-4-0 = 0+4+0 = 4 wheels
2. Locomotive #31: 0-4-0 = 0+4+0 = 4 wheels

6. Locomotive #89: 2-6-4 = 2+6+4 = 12 wheels
7. Locomotive #266: 2-8-4 = 2+8+4 = 14 wheels

Adding all these wheels together: 4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 60 wheels

The question asks for the total number of wheels on the listed steam locomotives, which requires a simple numerical answer.
