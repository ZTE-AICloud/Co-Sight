=======================================================================================

Progress: 2/6 steps completed (33.3%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 4 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Access the Wayback Machine website (web.archive.org)
   Notes: Successfully accessed the Wayback Machine and found the closest snapshots to our target dates:
- March 22, 2021: Snapshot from March 19, 2021 (URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20210319130629/https://www.virtuerestaurant.com/)

After analyzing snapshots from March 19, 2021 and April 23, 2021, I was able to extract and compare the dinner menus from both time periods.

Key findings:
1. I successfully extracted the "Large Rations" section (main courses) from both menus
2. Compared the main courses between the two dates
3. Identified that "Shrimp" (with "marsh hen mill buttered grits" for $22) was on the menu in March 2021 but was removed by April 2021
