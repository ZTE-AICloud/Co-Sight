The plan is still appropriate for the task at hand. We've completed Step 0 and identified that there was only one leap day before 2008 during Wikipedia's existence: February 29, 2004. This narrows down our search significantly.

The remaining steps are still relevant and necessary to complete the task. We need to continue with accessing the revision history for the Dragon page on that specific date, examining the edits, identifying the removed joke, and presenting it without punctuation.

Since no changes to the plan are needed, according to the replanning rules:

Plan does not need adjustment, continue execution

The next step is Step 1: Access Wikipedia's revision history for the 'Dragon' page, focusing specifically on February 29, 2004.

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify all leap days before 2008
   Notes: Identified all leap days before 2008. During Wikipedia's existence (which began in 2001), there was only one leap day before 2008: February 29, 2004. This is the date we need to focus on when examining the edit history of the Dragon Wikipedia page.

Step2 :[ ] Examine edits made on each leap day before 2008 (depends on: 0, 1)
Step3 :[ ] For each edit, check if any content was removed that could be considered a joke (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Identify the specific phrase that was removed (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Verify the removed content was indeed a joke (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Extract the exact phrase as it appeared, then remove punctuation (depends on: 5)
Step7 :[ ] Compile findings and present the answer (depends on: 6)

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify all leap days before 2008
   Notes: Identified all leap days before 2008. During Wikipedia's existence (which began in 2001), there was only one leap day before 2008: February 29, 2004. This is the date we need to focus on when examining the edit history of the Dragon Wikipedia page.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Access Wikipedia's revision history for the 'Dragon' page (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully accessed the Wikipedia revision history for the 'Dragon' page. Found that on February 29, 2004 (leap day), user Timwi made an edit at 15:41 with the comment "I admit, I did laugh. :-)". This edit removed a reference to Trogdor from the disambiguation list on the Dragon page.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Examine the specific edit made by Timwi on February 29, 2004 (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully examined the specific edit made by Timwi on February 29, 2004 at 15:41. The edit removed the phrase "Here be dragons:" which had been placed at the beginning of the disambiguation page. This was replaced with the more encyclopedic phrase "The term dragon may be referring to:". Timwi's edit comment "I admit, I did laugh. :-)" confirms they found the joke amusing but removed it to maintain Wikipedia's encyclopedic tone. This was the only edit made to the Dragon Wikipedia page on that leap day.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Extract the phrase 'Here be dragons:' as it appeared, then remove punctuation (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Based on the findings from Step 2, the phrase that was removed from the Wikipedia page for "Dragon" on February 29, 2004 (leap day) was "Here be dragons:". After removing the punctuation (the colon), the phrase becomes "Here be dragons". This is the answer to the question - the joke that was removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page on a leap day before 2008, without punctuation.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Compile findings and present the answer (depends on: 3)
   Notes: Based on our research through the Wikipedia revision history, we found that on February 29, 2004 (the only leap day before 2008 during Wikipedia's existence), user Timwi made an edit to the Dragon Wikipedia page. The edit removed the phrase "Here be dragons:" which had been placed at the beginning of the disambiguation page. This phrase is a historical cartographic reference often associated with dangerous or unexplored territories on ancient maps, making it a clever joke on a page about dragons. After removing the punctuation (the colon) as required by the question, the final answer is "Here be dragons". This phrase was replaced with the more encyclopedic "The term dragon may be referring to:" as part of Wikipedia's ongoing efforts to maintain an encyclopedic tone.
