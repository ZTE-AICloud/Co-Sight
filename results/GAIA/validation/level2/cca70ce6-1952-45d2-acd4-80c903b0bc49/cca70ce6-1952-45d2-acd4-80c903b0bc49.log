10. Subtract 43/50 from 19/33 - Student's answer: -469/1650

The quiz has no markings indicating correct or incorrect answers. I'll proceed to categorize each problem based on the scoring criteria and verify the correctness of the student's answers.
Details: 
Step1 :[✓] Categorize each problem based on the scoring criteria (add/subtract, multiply/divide, improper fraction, mixed number) (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I've categorized each problem based on the scoring criteria:

1. Problem 1: "Multiply 29/35 by 18/47" - This is a multiplication problem worth 10 points.
2. Problem 2: "Divide 31/50 by 2/36" - This is a division problem worth 10 points.
3. Problem 3: "Subtract 46/49 from 10/25" - This is a subtraction problem worth 5 points.
4. Problem 4: "Add 14/38 and 20/34" - This is an addition problem worth 5 points.
5. Problem 5: "Turn the improper fraction 85/32 into a mixed number" - This is a mixed number conversion problem worth 20 points.
6. Problem 6: "Turn the mixed number 8 2/5 into an improper fraction" - This is an improper fraction conversion problem worth 15 points.
7. Problem 7: "Add 22/47 and 8/11" - This is an addition problem worth 5 points.
8. Problem 8: "Multiply 13/42 by 35/39" - This is a multiplication problem worth 10 points.
9. Problem 9: "Turn the mixed number 32 5/9 into an improper fraction" - This is an improper fraction conversion problem worth 15 points.
10. Problem 10: "Subtract 43/50 from 19/33" - This is a subtraction problem worth 5 points.

Summary of point values:
- Addition/Subtraction problems (4 problems): 5 points each
- Multiplication/Division problems (3 problems): 10 points each
- Improper fraction conversion problems (2 problems): 15 points each
- Mixed number conversion problems (1 problem): 20 points each

Incorrect answers (2 problems):
1. Problem 3: Subtract 46/49 from 10/25 - Student answered 132/245, but the correct answer is -132/245 (student gave the absolute value)
2. Problem 6: Turn 8 2/5 into an improper fraction - Student answered 47/5, but the correct answer is 42/5

All calculations were verified using Python's Fraction class to ensure accuracy.
Step3 :[✓] Calculate the total points earned based on the scoring system (depends on: 2)
   Notes: I've calculated the total points earned by the student based on the scoring system and the problems they answered correctly.

The student answered 8 out of 10 problems correctly:
- Correct multiplication/division problems (3): 10 points each = 30 points
- Correct addition/subtraction problems (3): 5 points each = 15 points
- Correct improper fraction conversion (1): 15 points
- Correct mixed number conversion (1): 20 points

The total points earned before the bonus is 80 points.

The student missed:
- Problem 3 (subtraction): 0 points (incorrect)
- Problem 6 (improper fraction conversion): 0 points (incorrect)

This calculation has been verified using Python code that implements the scoring system.
Step4 :[ ] Add the 5 bonus points to determine the final score (depends on: 3)

To determine the student's score on the fraction quiz, I need to:

1. Identify all problems on the quiz and their types
2. Determine which problems were answered correctly
3. Calculate points based on the scoring system
4. Add the 5 bonus points
    raise NotADirectoryError(f"源文件夹不存在: {source_folder}")

From analyzing the image, I identified 10 problems:
- 4 addition/subtraction problems (5 points each)
- 3 multiplication/division problems (10 points each)
- 2 improper fraction conversion problems (15 points each)
- 1 mixed number conversion problem (20 points)

After checking each answer, I found the student answered 8 problems correctly:
- 3 multiplication/division problems (3 × 10 = 30 points)
- 3 addition/subtraction problems (3 × 5 = 15 points)
- 1 improper fraction conversion (1 × 15 = 15 points)
- 1 mixed number conversion (1 × 20 = 20 points)

The student's base score is 30 + 15 + 15 + 20 = 80 points.
Adding the 5 bonus points gives a final score of 85 points.
