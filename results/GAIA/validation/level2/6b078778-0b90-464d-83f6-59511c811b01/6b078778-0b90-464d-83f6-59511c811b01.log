result of search_wiki: Pope Paul V (Latin: Paulus V; Italian: Paolo V) (17 September 1550 – 28 January 1621), born Camillo Borghese, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 16 May 1605 to his death, in January 1621. In 1611, he honored Galileo Galilei as a member of the papal Accademia dei Lincei and supported his discoveries. In 1616, Pope Paul V instructed Cardinal Robert Bellarmine to inform Galileo that the Copernican theory could not be taught as fact, but Bellarmine's certificate allowed Galileo to continue his studies in search for evidence and use the geocentric model as a theoretical device. That same year Paul V assured Galileo that he was safe from persecution so long as he, the Pope, should live. Bellarmine's certificate was used by Galileo for his defense at the trial of 1633.

Plan: Research Metropolitan Museum Portrait Accession Number 29.100.5 and Its Subject's Episcopal Consecrators
===============================================================================================================

Progress: 2/5 steps completed (40.0%)
Status: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the portrait with accession number 29.100.5 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection
   Notes: I have successfully identified the portrait with accession number 29.100.5 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection. The portrait is by El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) and depicts Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara (1541-1609). The portrait was painted around 1600 and is considered one of El Greco's masterpieces. The portrait shows Fernando Ni?o de Guevara who was a Spanish cardinal, Archbishop of Seville, and Grand Inquisitor of Spain. This information provides a solid foundation for researching the subject's episcopal consecration details in the next steps.
Step1 :[?] Research Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's ecclesiastical career and appointments (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I have successfully researched Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's ecclesiastical career and appointments. Fernando Ni?o de Guevara (1541-1609) was created cardinal on June 5, 1596, by Pope Clement VIII. He was consecrated as bishop on October 10, 1599, with Pope Clement VIII as the principal consecrator and two co-consecrators: Camillo Borghese (who later became Pope Paul V in 1605) and Alfonso Visconti (Bishop of Cervia, who never became pope). In his career, Fernando Ni?o de Guevara served as Grand Inquisitor of Spain from 1599 to 1602 and then as Archbishop of Seville from 1601 until his death in 1609. This information provides the foundation for identifying which of his consecrators never became pope in the subsequent steps.
Step2 :[ ] Verify the information about Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's consecration (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Confirm Alfonso Visconti as the consecrator who never became pope (depends on: 1, 2)
Step4 :[ ] Compile the final answer with supporting evidence (depends on: 0, 1, 2, 3)

The co-consecrators were Camillo Borghese (who later became Pope Paul V in 1605) and Alfonso Visconti (Bishop of Cervia). 

From the Wikipedia page for Alfonso Visconti, I confirmed that he was born in 1552 in Milan, Italy, and died on September 19, 1608, in Macerata, Italy. He served as Bishop of Spoleto and was created a cardinal on March 3, 1599, by Pope Clement VIII. The historical records clearly show that Alfonso Visconti never became pope - he remained a cardinal until his death in 1608.

This verification confirms that of the three clerics involved in Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's episcopal consecration, Alfonso Visconti was the only one who never became pope: Clement VIII was already pope at the time of the consecration, and Camillo Borghese later became Pope Paul V.

Plan: Research Metropolitan Museum Portrait Accession Number 29.100.5 and Its Subject's Episcopal Consecrators
===============================================================================================================

Progress: 4/4 steps completed (100.0%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 0 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the portrait with accession number 29.100.5 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection
   Notes: I have successfully identified the portrait with accession number 29.100.5 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection. The portrait is by El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) and depicts Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara (1541-1609). The portrait was painted around 1600 and is considered one of El Greco's masterpieces. The portrait shows Fernando Ni?o de Guevara who was a Spanish cardinal, Archbishop of Seville, and Grand Inquisitor of Spain. This information provides a solid foundation for researching the subject's episcopal consecration details in the next steps.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's ecclesiastical career and appointments (depends on: 0)
   Notes: I have successfully researched Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's ecclesiastical career and appointments. Fernando Ni?o de Guevara (1541-1609) was created cardinal on June 5, 1596, by Pope Clement VIII. He was consecrated as bishop on October 10, 1599, with Pope Clement VIII as the principal consecrator and two co-consecrators: Camillo Borghese (who later became Pope Paul V in 1605) and Alfonso Visconti (Bishop of Cervia, who never became pope). In his career, Fernando Ni?o de Guevara served as Grand Inquisitor of Spain from 1599 to 1602 and then as Archbishop of Seville from 1601 until his death in 1609. This information provides the foundation for identifying which of his consecrators never became pope in the subsequent steps.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Verify the information about Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's consecration (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I have successfully verified the information about Cardinal Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's episcopal consecration. Multiple sources confirm that Fernando Ni?o de Guevara was consecrated as bishop on October 10, 1599, with Pope Clement VIII as the principal consecrator. The co-consecrators were Camillo Borghese (who later became Pope Paul V in 1605) and Alfonso Visconti (Bishop of Cervia). 

From the Wikipedia page for Alfonso Visconti, I confirmed that he was born in 1552 in Milan, Italy, and died on September 19, 1608, in Macerata, Italy. He served as Bishop of Spoleto and was created a cardinal on March 3, 1599, by Pope Clement VIII. The historical records clearly show that Alfonso Visconti never became pope - he remained a cardinal until his death in 1608.

This verification confirms that of the three clerics involved in Fernando Ni?o de Guevara's episcopal consecration, Alfonso Visconti was the only one who never became pope: Clement VIII was already pope at the time of the consecration, and Camillo Borghese later became Pope Paul V.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Compile the final answer with supporting evidence (depends on: 0, 1, 2)
   Notes: I have successfully compiled the final answer to the question about the Metropolitan Museum portrait's subject and his episcopal consecrators.

2. Co-consecrator: Camillo Borghese (who later became Pope Paul V in 1605)
3. Co-consecrator: Alfonso Visconti (Bishop of Cervia)
