   Notes: Successfully identified the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights on the horizon. The image is from August 3, 2015, titled "A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior." The description explicitly states "the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA." The image shows a rare red proton arc aurora over Lake Superior with the city lights of Marquette visible on the horizon. This completes our first step, and we can now proceed to determine that the city shown in the APOD image is Marquette, Michigan.
Step1 :[ ] Determine which city is shown in the identified APOD image (Marquette, Michigan) (depends on: 0)
Step2 :[ ] Research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Find the landmark building in Chicago named after the namesake of Marquette (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Research the architectural firm that designed this landmark building (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Verify the first name appearing in the architectural firm's name as of June 2023 (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Compile findings and provide the final answer (depends on: 5)

Plan: Research Plan to Identify Architectural Firm of Chicago Landmark
=======================================================================

Progress: 4/7 steps completed (57.1%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 3 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights on the horizon
   Notes: Successfully identified the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights on the horizon. The image is from August 3, 2015, titled "A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior." The description explicitly states "the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA." The image shows a rare red proton arc aurora over Lake Superior with the city lights of Marquette visible on the horizon. This completes our first step, and we can now proceed to determine that the city shown in the APOD image is Marquette, Michigan.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Determine which city is shown in the identified APOD image (Marquette, Michigan) (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Confirmed that the city shown in the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from August 3, 2015, titled "A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior," is Marquette, Michigan, USA. This information is explicitly stated in the image description on the official APOD website: "the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA." We can now proceed to research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully researched the namesake of Marquette, Michigan. The city was named after Father Jacques Marquette (1637-1675), a French Jesuit missionary and explorer who founded Michigan's first European settlement and explored the Mississippi River Valley. This information allows us to proceed to the next step of finding the landmark building in Chicago named after him.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Find the landmark building in Chicago named after the namesake of Marquette (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Successfully identified the landmark building in Chicago named after Jacques Marquette (the namesake of Marquette, Michigan). The landmark is the Marquette Building, located at 140 South Dearborn Street in Chicago. This building was completed in 1895 and is considered one of the best examples of the Chicago School of architecture. It has been designated as a Chicago Landmark, added to the National Register of Historic Places, and named a National Historic Landmark. The building was designed by the architectural firm Holabird & Roche, which later became known as Holabird & Root. This information allows us to proceed to the next step to research more about this architectural firm.
Details: 
Step4 :[ ] Research the architectural firm that designed this landmark building (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Verify the first name appearing in the architectural firm's name as of June 2023 (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Compile findings and provide the final answer (depends on: 5)

Plan: Research Plan to Identify Architectural Firm of Chicago Landmark
=======================================================================

Progress: 5/7 steps completed (71.4%)
Status: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights on the horizon
   Notes: Successfully identified the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights on the horizon. The image is from August 3, 2015, titled "A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior." The description explicitly states "the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA." The image shows a rare red proton arc aurora over Lake Superior with the city lights of Marquette visible on the horizon. This completes our first step, and we can now proceed to determine that the city shown in the APOD image is Marquette, Michigan.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Determine which city is shown in the identified APOD image (Marquette, Michigan) (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Confirmed that the city shown in the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from August 3, 2015, titled "A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior," is Marquette, Michigan, USA. This information is explicitly stated in the image description on the official APOD website: "the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA." We can now proceed to research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully researched the namesake of Marquette, Michigan. The city was named after Father Jacques Marquette (1637-1675), a French Jesuit missionary and explorer who founded Michigan's first European settlement and explored the Mississippi River Valley. This information allows us to proceed to the next step of finding the landmark building in Chicago named after him.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Find the landmark building in Chicago named after the namesake of Marquette (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Successfully identified the landmark building in Chicago named after Jacques Marquette (the namesake of Marquette, Michigan). The landmark is the Marquette Building, located at 140 South Dearborn Street in Chicago. This building was completed in 1895 and is considered one of the best examples of the Chicago School of architecture. It has been designated as a Chicago Landmark, added to the National Register of Historic Places, and named a National Historic Landmark. The building was designed by the architectural firm Holabird & Roche, which later became known as Holabird & Root. This information allows us to proceed to the next step to research more about this architectural firm.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Research the architectural firm that designed this landmark building (depends on: 3)
   Notes: Successfully researched the architectural firm that designed the Marquette Building in Chicago. The building was designed by Holabird & Roche, which later became known as Holabird & Root. The firm was founded in Chicago in 1880 and is Chicago's oldest architecture firm. According to the firm's official website (holabird.com), as of June 2023, the firm has two partners: Eric Risinger, AIA | NCARB and Rusty Walker, AIA | LEED AP. The firm also has one principal: Dennis Vovos, AIA | LEED AP, and several associate principals. The firm continues to provide architectural, engineering, interior design, and planning services. This information allows us to proceed to the next step to verify the first name appearing in the architectural firm's name as of June 2023.
Details: 
Step5 :[ ] Verify the first name appearing in the architectural firm's name as of June 2023 (depends on: 4)
Step6 :[ ] Compile findings and provide the final answer (depends on: 5)

=======================================================================

Progress: 6/7 steps completed (85.7%)
Status: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Identify the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights on the horizon
   Notes: Successfully identified the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights on the horizon. The image is from August 3, 2015, titled "A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior." The description explicitly states "the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA." The image shows a rare red proton arc aurora over Lake Superior with the city lights of Marquette visible on the horizon. This completes our first step, and we can now proceed to determine that the city shown in the APOD image is Marquette, Michigan.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Determine which city is shown in the identified APOD image (Marquette, Michigan) (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Confirmed that the city shown in the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from August 3, 2015, titled "A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior," is Marquette, Michigan, USA. This information is explicitly stated in the image description on the official APOD website: "the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA." We can now proceed to research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully researched the namesake of Marquette, Michigan. The city was named after Father Jacques Marquette (1637-1675), a French Jesuit missionary and explorer who founded Michigan's first European settlement and explored the Mississippi River Valley. This information allows us to proceed to the next step of finding the landmark building in Chicago named after him.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Find the landmark building in Chicago named after the namesake of Marquette (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Successfully identified the landmark building in Chicago named after Jacques Marquette (the namesake of Marquette, Michigan). The landmark is the Marquette Building, located at 140 South Dearborn Street in Chicago. This building was completed in 1895 and is considered one of the best examples of the Chicago School of architecture. It has been designated as a Chicago Landmark, added to the National Register of Historic Places, and named a National Historic Landmark. The building was designed by the architectural firm Holabird & Roche, which later became known as Holabird & Root. This information allows us to proceed to the next step to research more about this architectural firm.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Research the architectural firm that designed this landmark building (depends on: 3)
   Notes: Successfully researched the architectural firm that designed the Marquette Building in Chicago. The building was designed by Holabird & Roche, which later became known as Holabird & Root.
