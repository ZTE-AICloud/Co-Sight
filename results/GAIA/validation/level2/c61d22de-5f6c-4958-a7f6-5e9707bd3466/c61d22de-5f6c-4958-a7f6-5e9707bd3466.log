Plan: Research Plan to Find Word Connection Between arXiv Papers
=================================================================

Progress: 0/8 steps completed (0.0%)
Status: 0 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 8 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[ ] Search for AI regulation papers submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022
Step1 :[ ] Identify the specific paper about AI regulation with a figure containing three axes (depends on: 0)
Step2 :[ ] Analyze the figure to extract all label words at the ends of the three axes (6 words total) (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Search for Physics and Society articles submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016
Step4 :[ ] Review each 2016 paper to identify any that discuss types of societies (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Check if any of the words from the 2022 paper's figure appear in the 2016 paper describing a type of society (depends on: 2, 4)
Step6 :[ ] Compare the words to determine which one from the 2022 paper is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 paper (depends on: 5)
Step7 :[ ] Formulate the final answer with the specific word that appears in both papers (depends on: 6)

The key paper is "Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation" which was submitted to arXiv in June 2022 (published July 5, 2022). This paper contains a figure with three axes: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological ethics. Each axis has a label word at both ends, giving us six words total: Standardization, Localization, Utilitarianism, Egalitarianism, Consequential, and Deontological.

I also found a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, titled "Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints." This paper discusses types of societies, specifically mentioning "egalitarian" and "hierarchical" societies.

Comparing the words from both papers, I can confirm that "egalitarian" is the word that appears in both - it's one of the endpoints on the "Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism" axis in the 2022 paper, and it's used to describe a type of society in the 2016 Physics and Society paper.

This gives us six words at the ends of the axes: Standardization, Localization, Utilitarianism, Egalitarianism, Consequential, and Deontological.

2. The Physics and Society article from August 11, 2016 (arXiv:1608.03637) titled "Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints" discusses types of societies.

Comparing the words from both papers, "egalitarian" is the word that appears in both:
- It's one of the endpoints on the "Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism" axis in the 2022 paper
- It's explicitly used to describe a type of society in the 2016 Physics and Society paper

The question asks for a single word that appears in both papers and is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 paper. The answer is "egalitarian".
