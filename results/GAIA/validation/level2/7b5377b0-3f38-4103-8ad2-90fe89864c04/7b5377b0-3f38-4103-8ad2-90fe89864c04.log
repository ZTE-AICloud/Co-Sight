result of search_wiki: The Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (Spanish: Acta de la Declaraci√≥n de Independencia de Venezuela) is a document drafted and adopted by Venezuelan on July 5, 1811, through which Venezuelans made the decision to separate from the Spanish Crown in order to establish a new nation based on the premises of equality of individuals, abolition of censorship and dedication to freedom of expression. These principles were enshrined as a constitutional principle for the new nation and were radically opposed to the political, cultural, and social practices that had existed during three hundred years of colonization.


== Content ==
Seven of the ten provinces belonging to the Captaincy General of Venezuela declared their independence and explained their reasons for this action, among them, that it was baneful that a small European nation ruled the great expanses of the New World, that Spanish America recovered its right to self-government after the abdications of Charles IV and Ferdinand VII at Bayonne, and that the political instability in Spain dictated that Venezuelans rule themselves, despite the brotherhood they shared with Spaniards. The seven provinces were Caracas Province, Cuman√° Province, Barinas Province, Margarita Province, Barcelona Province, M√©rida Province and Trujillo Province.
The three remaining provinces (Maracaibo Province, Coro Province and Guayana Province) did not take part in the Venezuelan congress opted to stay under Spanish rule.

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Research the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence and identify the last two digits (L)
   Notes: Research confirms that the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 5, 1811. Therefore, the last two digits of the year (L) are 11.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research the number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white (A)
   Notes: After researching the TikTok logo colors as of July 2023, I found that the TikTok logo consists of three main colors: pink/red, aqua/blue, and black. Since we need to exclude black and white from our count, the number of colors in the TikTok logo (A) is 2. This is confirmed by multiple sources including Design Pieces and LogoPoppin, which describe the TikTok logo as having a color scheme of pink/red, aqua/blue, and black. Therefore, A = 2.

Step2 :[?] Research the height of the average woman in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, and round to the nearest whole centimeter (C)
   Notes: According to a July 2023 Business Insider article, the average height of Filipino women is 149.6 centimeters (4 feet 10.89 inches). Rounding this to the nearest whole centimeter gives us 150 cm. Therefore, C = 150.

   Notes: I calculated the derivative d/dx of (A * x-squared) where A = 2. Using calculus rules, the derivative of A*x? with respect to x is 2*A*x. Since A = 2, the derivative is 2*2*x = 4x. Therefore, d/dx(A * x?) = 4x.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Substitute all values into the equation: Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4097 - C (depends on: 0, 1, 2, 3)
   Notes: I've substituted all the values into the equation:
Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4097 - C

Substituting L = 11, d/dx(A * x?) = 4x, and C = 150:
11x = 4x + 4097 - 150
11x = 4x + 3947

This equation is now ready to be solved for x in the next step.

Progress: 6/7 steps completed (85.7%)
Status: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 1 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Research the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence and identify the last two digits (L)
   Notes: Research confirms that the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 5, 1811. Therefore, the last two digits of the year (L) are 11.
Details: 
Step1 :[?] Research the number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white (A)
   Notes: After researching the TikTok logo colors as of July 2023, I found that the TikTok logo consists of three main colors: pink/red, aqua/blue, and black. Since we need to exclude black and white from our count, the number of colors in the TikTok logo (A) is 2. This is confirmed by multiple sources including Design Pieces and LogoPoppin, which describe the TikTok logo as having a color scheme of pink/red, aqua/blue, and black. Therefore, A = 2.
Details: 
Step2 :[?] Research the height of the average woman in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, and round to the nearest whole centimeter (C)
   Notes: According to a July 2023 Business Insider article, the average height of Filipino women is 149.6 centimeters (4 feet 10.89 inches). Rounding this to the nearest whole centimeter gives us 150 cm. Therefore, C = 150.
Details: 
Step3 :[?] Calculate the derivative d/dx of (A * x-squared) (depends on: 1)
   Notes: I calculated the derivative d/dx of (A * x-squared) where A = 2. Using calculus rules, the derivative of A*x? with respect to x is 2*A*x. Since A = 2, the derivative is 2*2*x = 4x. Therefore, d/dx(A * x?) = 4x.
Details: 
Step4 :[?] Substitute all values into the equation: Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4097 - C (depends on: 0, 1, 2, 3)
   Notes: I've substituted all the values into the equation:
Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4097 - C

Substituting L = 11, d/dx(A * x?) = 4x, and C = 150:
11x = 4x + 4097 - 150
11x = 4x + 3947

This equation is now ready to be solved for x in the next step.
Details: 
Step5 :[?] Solve the equation for x (depends on: 4)
   Notes: I solved the equation for x by isolating the variable:
11x = 4x + 3947
11x - 4x = 3947
7x = 3947
x = 3947 / 7
x = 563.8571428571429

The exact value of x is 563.8571428571429, which will be rounded to the nearest tenth in the next step.

To solve this problem, I needed to find the values of L, A, and C, then calculate the derivative, substitute all values into the equation, solve for x, and round to the nearest tenth.

Step 1: I found that L = 11, which are the last two digits of 1811, the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence.

Step 2: I determined that A = 2, which is the number of colors in the TikTok logo (pink/red and aqua/blue) as of July 2023, excluding black and white.

Step 3: I found that C = 150, which is the average height of Filipino women (149.6 cm) according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, rounded to the nearest whole centimeter.

Step 4: I calculated the derivative d/dx of (A * x?) = d/dx of (2 * x?) = 4x.

Step 5: I substituted all values into the equation:
Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4097 - C
11x = 4x + 4097 - 150
11x = 4x + 3947

Step 6: I solved for x:
11x - 4x = 3947
7x = 3947
x = 3947 / 7
x = 563.8571428571429

Step 7: I rounded to the nearest tenth:
563.8571428571429 rounds to 563.9

Therefore, the value of x to the nearest tenth is 563.9.
